Davion's office~
You see a small desk with maps and scrools littered on it. The room is lightly
furnished. A small mirror hangs on the wall , a cabinet with some plain tunics
and a big armchair behind the desk. The maps and scolls depict the area of
Rivendell , all of it's main buildings and and roads can be seen on it. In an
other corner is a small table with hudreds of small figurines. Some are sailors
some look like guards , and more are trees , and dogs and buildings. It seems Davion is trying to construct a little down with miniature fig
urines. The details a fine and good to see. A lot of work as been put in the
map and the model. Better not touch anything. Behing the armchair , is a great
standard . On it is the symbol of Davion's faith and religion : A Sword of
Flames piercing the sun , Symbol of the God of Justice and Truth : TYR .

You are on Sunset Pier. The waves strike the bottom of the pier with a steady

It looks like a sprawling serpent, looking for a path across the mountains to
the south , and north to the sea. Across the shore you see the old forest road
with it's usual travelers. They are tiny little dots and nothing can be
distinguised from them. You have a commanding view of the sunset from this van
tage point. Immeadiatly to the north is the Riverboat Swanmay. It's sails are
down, and sailors scurry along with their work. You can climb aboard the ship
via the wooden gang planks.

You are on the longest part of the wooden piers of Rivendell. The sounds are
incredible to behold. Seagulls Squeak and Squal in the skies. The waves are
huge and are crashing down on the support beams down below. The wind is hur
ing past with great ease and heart pounding speed. You see the Great White
Ship, Sword Maiden , swaying in the winds wrath. You are very far out on the
great river and the sight of this Ship is absolutly amazing. It stand, from
hull to top of the mast, about 90 paces high , and about 200 feet in lenght.
it has beautifull white sails , and most of her hull is painted with white
stripes. It is a sight not many hold , and perhaps one of the greatest ships
to have even sailed to sea.

very quiet at the moment, it's crew probably sprawling on half the city squares
drunk and singing the blues. The Sands of a beach can be seen west of here but
you must go back to Harbor Road to reach it. There is an eerie feeling to this
small boat, anchored to your west.

and are very small and fragile. There is a small fireplace and bed here , but

Cemetary~
You are in a graveyard , but cemetary is the name used by Citizens of Riven
dell. The are arrogant and truly ungratefull of their lives for this Cemetary
is what many a poor man has left of familly and loved ones. This place is not
for the likes of the rich and famous , but the poor and miserable. You've
over heard a conversation once in a tavern , two sailors conversing with drun
ken tongues. They said that the rich burry their loved ones on small boats
and set them off on the river , burning in flames. They are given a great cere
mony of departure , their sould being guided to heaven. The sailors were compl
aining that only a rich man could afford a proper burial , for the cost of a
small boat is often more than what a sailor can afford in one years wages. The
cemetary goes on west and south from here.

gargoyle. Gargoyles are said to be guardians of the dead , preventing them
from ever escaping the earth from where they were burried. When a Gargoyle
is place on top of a tomb , or even grave , it is because the spirit inside
the tomb is Evil and twisted , and will seek to do harm upon the innocent and
weak. To the north and east the cemetary runs on.

a Rundown Tavern~
You are in a dump. This place is so disgusting that revolsion is not strong
enough a word to describe it. The place , named Fallen Axe , looks like a dra
gon slept here and had a REAL bad dream. To the west , it looks like there is
a room , even sleeaier than this one , and to the north , the exit , sweet exit
back to the Pauper's alley. In a corner , a drunken sailor sings the blues...
something about getting in trouble when none was called for... Tis perhaps a
warning you should heed.

Kitchen~
Rats eat of some of the meat they serve here. A cat is roasting on a pit, pro
bably today's chicken special. The chef looks at you , and asks you to scram
out of his Kicthen. You are only to happy to oblige yourself. The only exit
is east , back in the dump of a tavern . One wonders why this place even still
exists!

Cigar Lounge~
A Cigar lounge? What a great idea! But why would they built it here , in the
middle of Pauper's Alley? People are smoking cigars and cigarettes in your face
and the air is really think with smoke. The sting of the smoke is rather anno
ying and you are getting weary of it. People here don't seem to mind. In a cor
ner you see a sailor approaching a lady , slipping her a few coins , and they
head west into a small shabby room . Now you understand this place reason. To
your south , you can exit to Pauper's Alley , and you can also , for a few
silvers , go west in the shabby room.

Shabby Room~
You are in a small bedroom , the prostitute you asked to accompany you is sta

a surprising fact as this is considered a poor sector of town. The are little
windows and some sunlight streams in from the outside. Looking back at your
partner , you notice that the prostitute is laying naked in the bed , awaiting
you arival with some impatience for the next customers all already waiting in
line for you to finish and let their turn come. The only exit is back east ,
when you will be done here first , of course.

You are in a large house. A person , a young female , in rags and shambles,
approached you. " You've need of some place to sleep dear sir? I've a small
room for you , and ye need not pay ... This free " , she tells you as you 
look at her. So you determine that this place is a pauper's inn , heh! Free
but so unclean it is almost ridiculous to think of sleeping here. Still , it
will do for those who cannot pay for regular lodging. It is not expected to
sleep here , and expect your purse under your pillow as it was placed during
the night. You may leave Kayla's House by the east , to pauper's District.

orderly. The steps that lead up to it's entrance have been sweeped and looked
taken care of , as does the roof and even windows. Small green and red flowers

woman. To the east and west , the Tower Road continues.

To the east and west , the Tower Road stretches on. To the west , the Great Mage
Tower can still be seen , but is getting smaller and smaller as you continue

you in every direction , the smells of food , armor , sweat and money , lots
of money can be perceived. This place is the ideal place to make a worthwhile
purchase or to sell a unsued item. It is also the greatest haven for thieves
as the foreigners to the City are as naive as the young child playing in the
streets ... perhaps even more.

You are in the Middle of Tarlomen's Square. It is said my many of these town

spells that could help build and shape the earth and stones used to build the
town of Rivendell. It seems now that his help was long lasting, as most of the
buildings seem to have passed the test of time. Still standing strong, there
are not many buildings that he enchanted , one of them being the mage Tower
and the two other were the Church and the City Hall. These buildings have sto
od where so many others fell. He was a credit , as both mage and citizen , of
Rivendell. He is now honored with a town square named after him. To the north

are absolutly horrid and old. They stink of poor people and cruel times. You
see a door , a large door , to the north , leading to an old warehouse. Who
knows what it's shadows may hide. Beggars line the street and are almost half
dead by famine. This part of the town is not talked about much by any innKee
pers or tavern owners. Rivendell's citizens have done well , and these are the
ones that did not. To the east is Rock Beach Gate and this alley goes on to

even noticed your arrival. You look at one of the Headstones , it reads:
Jondalar , My son , so young , and so proud ... We shall love you always.
birth : year of the Tiger , Death Year of the Pock "
 
It is a very sad place to be , weeping and crying is common ... Perhaps it wou
ld be better to leave this depressing area soon , before it affects you too.
You can leave by going either east or north , but either way , you will still
be in the cemetary.

You are in a residential part of town.  All around you are houses of varying
sizes, but they are all beautifully constructed. One strange occurance , bec
ause the city is built close to the river , the house have slipped a bit and
are sort of leaning toward each other, creating a semblance of shadows and very
little light. To the north is prosperity road and to your south is beach side
road.

In a House~
This house obviously belongs to the carpenter in town.  Lovingly crafted
chairs and tables adorn the room.  He has also made several frames for
mirrors and paintings which hang about the room but the rest of the decor is
rather plain. To the south , through the door , is Merchant Way , and you can
see the Carpenter's stall across the street. Hope he did not see you enter his
house.

In a House~
You are standing in the house of a merchant.  This merchant is not very rich
as seen by the absence of gold or silver in his house.  He does have a good
eye for color though and this room is very pleasing to the eye.  It would be
nice to relax in here but the merchant might come home.  You can get back
to the merchant way south , by the door you entered.

In a House~
You are in a very small but beautiful home.  The owner has decorated the
house to make it seem larger.  All the colors in here are pastels, a strong
difference from most of the other houses in the city.  Maybe it is part of
the Great Game, trying to confuse people and put them off guard.  You will
never know since the owner is nowhere to be seen.  Tower Road is to the east

Cemetary~
You have entered the lands of the dead , better known as the cemetary. before
you are hundreds of small landmarks ( crosses, headstones and wooden swords )
are here , marking the passage of life to death. One of the customs of Riven
dell is too place a wooden sword straight down in the earth , up to the hilt
where the dead are burried. The is a simple reason , and it has much to do with
superstition and legend. It is said that if you burry a familly member and that
his heart is not covered by a sword , what will stop him from raising up from
the ground and come back to life. Althought this is perhaps only myth, it is
also said that Rivendell has never , EVER , had vampires wonder or inhabit the
town! To the east is a gate leading to the Old Alley , the cemetary is all 
around you , north and west.

south. This gate is made of the old beams used in the first Piers built in 
Rivendell. On the fences are numerous signs of graffity. " I LOVE SANJA FOR
EVER " and " Kendrack was here " are but some examples of the marks left by
young citizens, dead a long time ago. This part of Beach Side road is seldomed

she holds in her hands a sword , polished on one side , and rusted on the oth

the dead ones soul is pure and honest ... it will make the sword gleam with
new polished light. If it is corrupt , evil and twisted , the sword will turn
to rust , and so will the soul . Should the sword be rusted , the soul is to
be dammed and sent to hell , if polished , then the soul is to go back in the
garden of the dead , and play as children do with the other souls ... until
called back in another body on Thera , as the gods desire. The Cemetary sur

use. Most of this stuff if used old or even broken but the beggars do not care
as broken is better than nothing. It is a custom ( thought not required ) to
kneel down on the altar before the god's charity and thank them in prayer for
anything found in the pit. To the south is the common square and to the west

You are in the Healer's Heaven.  Most of these so called healers
are little mo re than Doctors of Vetenarians.  Most cast cast a
simple healing spell.  The only one that can do so is an old priest
than has seen too much roadfires and camp sites for his age.  He is
now retired but still is in contact with his god , that is when he is
not drunk or affected by a hangover.  Of course , since he is no
longer adventuring for his god , he must ask a small fee for any of
his services and his idea of small is affected by the strong smell of
alchool.  To the south is the court of statues and to the east the
Altar of Charity.  To the west is the preacher's hall , a area you
would try to avoid if you'd be as drunk as this healer.

the harvest because of their disbelief. He blames the unfaithfull for the comi
ng of the mutant hordes in the wilderness, Monsters of the dead. He explains
to the little crowd that if you die without belief , you become one of the evil
mutants in the forest , for the gods do not accept your soul and reject it back
with all it's evil taint onto the world below. There is a stair leading up and
down from here. The church of holy vows is to the south and the Healer's Heaven
is to the east.

chant. They seem to be gathering in the middle of the chamber, around a small
altar. Sitting on the altar is a small woman. She seems to have a terrified
look on her face. The robed men approach her and start chanting a prayer. They
all are communing together for the gods to here of their prayers. The woman is
bound to the altar and cannot flee. The chanting reaches a Cresendo and the
woman yells out in excrutiating pain. A robed figure then raises a hand for si
lence. When silence is achieved , he speaks out : " Fellow priest , this was
necessary , for she has commited a crime against us. She has stolen a child born
from a priest of our order , and tried to hide it from us. For this crime , she
was punished. Mark well these words , We will not accept any acts of crime aga
inst us for any reason , and let the Wrath of God be out judgement! ". The robed
figures raised a cheer over the unconscious body of the woman.

religious followers are in prayer before the Altar of the Gods. These believers

thing to do in the quest for revelation. The Priest is not present at the moment
probably in his quarters or perhaps in the preacher's chambers north of here.
South of this place is the main of the City , Prosperity Road.

go through School also, heh! Guess this is were all of your life really starts.

House of the Holy Blades~
You are in the great Defender's Guildhouse , better known as the
house of holy blades.  These are the men and women that make the true
difference in any town.  Not only do they help out when war time
comes and for any type of conflict , they are also helpers of the
weak , the innocent and the old and yound.  You see a defender would
never turn his back on his fellow citizen and would rather see
himself poor and in taters than to let a friend down , when in need. 
These men and women are not stupid or naive , they simply warm
hearted and sincere.  Expect help from anythem , if you truly need
it.  And expect a sword in your throat if you try to use them for any
evil deed.  To the north , prosperity road and across from it is the
Church of Holu Vows.  To the West is the Training appartments of the
Blades of the Holy Vows.

their prices around depending on the asker ... One was a poor merchant and his
wife , and the price for a certain ball of cloth was 2 silvers,  and when a few
minutes later a rich citizen asked for a price on the same ball of cloth , the
merchant replied " for a man like you , this cloth is but 4 silvers , and a
worth while product for you to purchase! " . Smirking , you continue on your

for a war or something. After asking around a bit , a merchant tells you that
this is a normal day here , and that come war time , there are only armies in
these streets. With that rather cynical thought in mind , you notice a clock
makers shop to the north and a farmers stall to the west. The Market square
continues its sprawling tents and small stalls east and south of here.

with 4 pillars. They are named , Pillar of Strenght , Pillar of Stealth , Pil
lar of Cunning and Pillar of Luck. These have been named after the events that
have transpired over the years. For example , the pillar of luck. A man named
Jandros cursed and insulted a patrolman years back , as he was stepping out
of a tavern. The Patrolman insisted on a Arena Match. The next day , the match
was setup, and a huge crowd attented. Jandros was still drunk and more than sick
and he puked next to the pillar of luck. When the fight started , the patroman
advanced on him within seconds , and was about to strike a hard blow when his
feet met the vomit on the floor. He slipped and fell to the ground hard, and
was knocked out! Jandros was named Victor , and has since then been awarded
with free drinks in every tavern of Rivendell. As was said , many have gained
fame and many , like the patrolman , have lost it. The entrance to the Arena
proper is down. North leads back to the Road of Champions.

here and the poor sleep in the street. In a small corner , you see children
playing with a ball. After looking at them for a moment, you notice that the
ball is in fact the head of a dog that has been chopped off at the neck. They
play with it and kick the head in between to post. The game almost looks fa
miliar. The dog was probably killed for food. These people look at you with
envy and seem to be eyeing your purses. The old alleyway goes on west and east

are at the fire drinking what little money they can, warming their souls if
not their bodies. To the north is a small borken door that leads to another
old warehouse. The sides of the building have long been standing and look 
ready to drop. Some support beams have been put up to hold it , but this is 
temporary and dangerous. The whole thing could collapse at any moment. To the
west you can see the end of the alleyway and a small gate leading to the ceme

the old alleyway is a haven for the unfortunate of Rivendell.

the peace and silence of eternal sleep. That last sentence was writen on the
wall of a ruined building , probably a house , and it forbodes your entry to
the cemetary.

Wall Road~
You are on the northern end of Wall Road . In front of you , north of here ,is
the southern entrance to the Great Mage Tower of Rivendell. Legend has it that
in time of war , the two doors that lead to the mage tower are invisible and
that the only way to enter is through the rooftop. A legend ? only the birds
can say , and the mages themselves! To your east , a small group of shops adorn
Mage Street , taking advantage of the fact that many tourist come by this area
to obserb the Tower up close. South , Wall Road streches on , going from the
northern end to the southern end of the city , to the Cemetary , passing by
the Western City Gates.

Wall Road~
You are on Wall Road. To your west , a Huge wall that surrounds the city con
nects to the great Mage Tower up ahead. It is near impossible to distinguish
the details of it's great spires from the ground , so close to it's base. To
the north , wall Road leads you to the southern entrance of the Tower. And to
the south , Wall Road lead on back to the gates , but that is many block further
down.

Wall Road~
You are now in the shadow of the Great Mage Tower. It's Towering heights loo

A citizen is here making a small paiting of the Tower , perhaps to try to sell
it to the newcomers of Rivendell , or to trade it in exchange for some food on
which he must substain himself during the hard winters.

Wall Road~
You are on Wall Road. not much can be said about this area , except the Great
looming presence of the Mage Tower north. You are not quite there yet , a few
block north should get you to it's doors. It is a magnificient Tower , build
long ago by the great mage Midean , whose name was honored in market place. 
They built a fountain with a statue of him on it , in the middle of market
Square and called it , Midean's Square. South , is wall Square , with it's th
ousands of birds.

You are on Wall Road , nothing peculiar at this point to notice . The great
city wall to your west has little holes and crack , someone put a small piece
of paper in one of the cracks ... it reads : Meet me at 9 pm , and bring the
flowers and wine , you lucky dog! love vannesa ." It seems these wall have
seen much action , perhaps not all of them battles ... wall road goes on north
and south. You can see Wall Square north from here.

from here , as you are not to close , nor to far to distinguish the features
of the tower. It has many windows and you can even see people inside , most
probably mages practicing spells or artifices. The City Wall is standing tall
to your west and Wall road runs north and south.

it one of the most traveled. The City Wall is to your west and is about 15
paces high. It's surface is smooth and it is near imposible to climb.

iron and are of gothic design. Two small stone gargoyles adorn the top of the
gates , to protect the innocent from the dead. You can see mourners on the
other side of the gates , weeping the deaths of loved ones. To the north is
Wall Road , and the Great Mage Tower can be seen , looming shadows all over
the city.

or section of the town. This area used to house the greatest shops in the city
of Rivendell. An old sign hangs from a broken post , it reads : Midean's Fine
Wands. That somehow is rather bizarre. Why would one of the greatest mages to
have lived in Rivendell , have his shop in this order. The questions are many
but the only way to get answers would be to visit the mage tower. To your north
is Merchant Way and the market beyond.

some of these poor make up for wealth with nice flowers and colors adorning
the house they hold so dear. To the north is the begining of Merchant's Way
and Pauper's Alley continues West and East from here.

It is darker in this part of the alley. Shadows play tricks on the walls cre
ating the image of something that is not there. Many times , you feel like you
have been followed and that someone is stalking you. Turning back, the shadows
move ever so lightly and perhaps it was just a flicker of light... or were tho
the white of someone's eyes ? You quicken your pace despite yourself. There is
sound , alot of sound coming from your east, probably a tavern or something ,
and to your west , the darkness of the alley is diminished and you can see
small houses there. Pauper's alley run west and east form here.

He looks at you and then turns around in indeffirence. The shop seems to sell
scrolls and the a "list" of prices is on the board , depicting all the things
you can buy.

are here! The are hundreds of shelves with hundreds of little vials and small
bottles. in the middle of the shop , almost exotic looking , is a statue of
a Scorpion , almost 3-4 feet large , and standing in a box of sand. The box
has been raised on a pedestal and is about waist high, making the scorpion 
look you directly in the eyes . The over all appearance is one of guardianship
Knowing that you are in a Shop on Mage street , you can't help to wonder if
the owner can make this thing move , or even attack , any unwanted customers!
North is the only exit , and leads back to the Tower Square.

wonderfull , and you can only wonder at what a whole chicken could do to your

he build this place so that the mages could come and eat some real food , and
his shop is going very well, his initiative being extremely profitable.

This is another exmaple of the shabby lifestyles of the poor and miserable.
There is a small bucket in a corner , stinking from champer pot uses, and in
another corner is a small fireplace with rotten wood stacked next to it. The
owner is not present , and by the looks of the place , he would be a sailor
for there are numerous nets and fishing poles here. He is probably away on the
river , better there than here.

Muscular, standing next to a spit , roasting some skinny dogs and cats. People
are waiting patiently for the food to cook. The Man keeps any aggressive men
from taking and running with the food. You are not welcomed here , and are
asked to leave ... unless you are willing to pay for some dog meat! The only
way out is in , east to Pauper's Corner

You are in a poor man's house. The one disturbing thing about is that it is
clean and devoid of dust. No foot steps lead in this place and no light reaches
your eyes from holes from the roof or walls. It has been patched and beams have
put up to support the falling roof. In the northern corner , Furtiture has 
been stacked up one on the other , like a small mountain of debris . They have
been pushed there to make room in the rest of the small house. You hear noises
in your back ... Probably just the beggars from the pauper's district east and
out of the house.

filled with clothing of many kinds. Yellow dresses , blue leather jerkin , you
name it , it is there. The lady of the house has taste as can be seen. In the
middle of the room is a big four post bed that look used and warned , but still
incredibly comfortable. The only way out , is in , back east to the main hall
of the house.

end of the house. To the west is a nice oak door and it looks to lead to the
bedroom. North is the Tower Road. You can hear the children playing outside.

closet and at the foot of the bed is a chest. The only exit is back east , in
the main hall of the house. There is a window here , and you think you see a
man clad in armor approaching. Your heart pounds , but it is only the reflec
tion of the sun off a young childs make belief armor , the lid of a trash can.

These weapons are shining and polished , being the pride and joy of it's user
the commander. To the west , a corridor lead away in a bedroom. To your north
is the Tower Road. Perhaps it would be wiser to get out , before the commander
returns.

Pauper's District~
This is pauper's district. Garbage and greasy bundles litter the small street
and roads. There are no clean stops at all. Children scream and play as if
nothing is wrong , in there view ... there is nothing wrong, But that view
will probably change when they will have to beg and steal for a living later
on. You notice a bigger house on the east. This is a rather unsual sight as
most of the buildings are either very small and worn , or old and rundown.
This building looks almost fresh. Thought garbage heaps still litter it's en
trance and the people coming in and out of the house are still poor and un
healthy , it seems this house is almost a new addition to the district. Why
a erson would want to build in this corner is beyond comprehension. To the
north is pauper's square and to your west is Pauper's Corner.

and keeping warm close to the firepit. To your north and east are the Pauper's

rather poor looking house. To the west and south are the Pauper's Districts
and the seat of misery of Rivendell. Althought Rivendell is a prosperous place
to most of it's citizens , it is obvious that some were left out. Probably
sailors and merchants that lost all their belongings to one or another gambl
ing facility. To your east is pauper's alley.

You are in the pauper's district of the town. Rivendell is said to have many
beggars and poor , most unfortunates that have lost their lot in life to dice
and ale. You can see on the faces of the people here that they are in sorrow
and pain , most will never enjoy the comforts of even a good bed. There is
a small building to your west , two beggars stand in front of the door , asking
for money to help in there pains. Pauper's corner is further down south and
pauper's square is east of here. One most unusual sight if north of here. It
used to be somekind of a tower , now it is a small ruin. This is one of the
oldest parts of the city and the door leading to the tower has been sealed off
years ago , to prevent people from goind in and risking their lives on unsafe
stone blocks.

ready to be used as iron pumpers for the muscle maniaks that are mercernaries.
People of all type have joined this band and are training at the moment. In a
corner , you see an old one-eye grizzled veteran shouting encouragements to a
young pupil. He spots you and says : " When i Was younger , i could of lifted
ten times what this one is pulling! My name Kodar , and tis a pleasure to meet
you my friends , what can i do for yall? ". This is the Mercernary's Leader and
trainer and alot can be learned from him. Back south is the entrance to the
