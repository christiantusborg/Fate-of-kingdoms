Dear mom,
 
   I'm having a great time here in Elvandar! I never
knew such a beautiful place could exist in this world.
The elves are friendly and helpful, not at all like their
high elf cousins, although I've seen a few of those snobs
around too.
Anyways I've been to so many sites here and seen so much,
I wish you could have been here with me. The only
discouraging thing was that the castle where the Elvandar
king lives is off limits to those who are not of elven
royalty. They even have a big scary dragon guarding the
entrance too!! Well I have to get going now, say hi to dad
for me. Ciao!

To the bairer of this note, I warn thee to listen.
Enclosed in my Pendant I have left this note along with three
other vials.  These vials contain three things...now listen closely.
In one, you will find the answer to all your unanswered questions,
that have annoyed monks, scholars and teachers for all of time.
In the second, you will find the truth of what happens behind your
backs.  What goes on in your everyday life...and you might even be
apart of it...
The third and final vial contains a ride that will send you straight
past the gates of Hades, to where you will await your destiny...
To the one who bares this note, I would stop.  These three vials
can change your fate in the blink of an eye.  And I am note one
who would want to control your fate...and I am sure, you aren't
either.  Not because you don't want to, but because you can't.  
The gods decide your fate, not yourself.  Destroy these potions
when you get them, they can only bring trouble.
 
Warlock Ferury, the great Elven Magus.

lives in the last room.  This hallway hav lots of trees pictures and
some strange animal's heads attached to the walls of the hallway.

Hallway~
A long hallway leads you to a variety of rooms.  But all the doors
are locked and shut so don't even think of entering.  Nothing
interesting down this hallway except the usual elegance and decor
that makes you want to puke.

Hallway~
A long hallway leads you to a variety of rooms.  Leading to the
second floor, a grand staircase covered in plush red carpet sweeps
gracefully upwards, stopping at yet another golden door.  The elven
king seems to have quite a taste for gold stuff.  The kind of person
he must be is obvious by his extravagent taste and lavish living. 
Large gilded doors north block your way to the sounds and noises of
laughter.  Soft music drifts from the other side, must be quite a
party over there.

Ballroom of the Palace~
Dancers and Acrobats twirl and glide amongst beautiful gowns and
stylish suits.  Groups of elves gather to discuss the latest gossip
and whatever is troubling the king at this time.  Servants carefully
balancing sweet elvish wine step delicately so as not to spill the
drinks meant for nobles.  At the far end of the ballroom, a great
throne has been brought to overlook everybody on the dance floor. 
Lavish and covered completely in jewels, it could feed an entire
kingdom if somebody had the nerve to steal it.  But at this time,
nobody occupies it, the king being nowhere found.

Registry Hall~
This is the registry hall.  If you are unhappy with your hometown
you can resign and choose another..  For a fee.  A perky, cute
looking elf with large-rimmed glasses keeps all the files on citizens
of Elvandar organized precisely, so there is no confusion of a
person's history.

This is the guardroom, where two guards stand to protect the king
and keep evil from harming him.  They are rather large for elves,

Other locations of Thera.  There is a wooden sign to the right in the

Well, you were right.  This place is full of great food just
waiting to be stolen-I mean eaten.  The table fills a good portion of
the room, with many high back chairs surrounding it.  There is a
metal door north, and the sounds of much banging and crashing can be
heard, with the occasional curse of profanity.

Military Street~
Elven soldiers train diligently with their Captains, preparing for
anything that might happen.  The trees here are more sparse, but the
elves are definately more populous.  Nearly half the citizens of
Elvandar must be Soldiers, which explains how they are so well
defended and powerful.  For some reason there are no females
present...  How sexist of the military.  Apparently they see them to
be fit only for secretaries and other light work.

Weaponry Building~
Weapons of all sorts line the walls or racks, all carefully
catalogued and numbered for easy picking.  The majority of the
weapons are thin and lightweight for elvish use, but there is the odd
battle axe and heavy spear for mercenary use.  Behind a large anvil a
human blacksmith pounds away at a sword, tempering it to perfection. 
The loud ringing from his hammer can be heard everywhere.

sacred walls of this section of town.  One shop in particular stands
out to the north, a large sign with the words "Potions for Sale!" 
Spelled out in elegant letters.  To the south, faint sounds of people
dying and in pain can be heard.

Not as impressive as the bottom floor, this area is a lot less
noisy and a lot quieter below.  Servants carrying lavish trays of
food walk down the stairs, coming from the direction west.  This
place seems to be full of large, giant doors.  The king must have a
fetish for large things..  To the north and east are two pairs of
heavy gold doors, the initials "K.  E" engraved on the ones east. 
The sound of talking can be heard coming south, and the rustle of
armor.  Something is being guarded, but the question is what?

door to the east.  The succulent scent of meat juices fills the air,
along with the tangy sweetness of desserts.  The door is slightly
ajar, and you can see a wonderful feast on the other side fit for a
king.  Wait a minute, it probably is for the king.

and a couple wounded from various accidents.  A sense of peace and a
tranquility fills the air, while the trees present in this holy
sanctuary seem to glow with an aura of purity.

More doors, to the north.  Nothing written on these ones.  Just
the usual gold with intricate designs.  The sounds of paper being
shifted and a cough every now and then can be heard, but it's hard to

Armor and weapons line the walls around you, a startling contrast

decoration.  Although it may not be as impressive as the rest of the
palace, it still holds its own air of power these halls.  Dim,
flickering torches are sparsely placed, not giving much in the way of
illumination.

This is the office of Kabrok, one of the most famous elves in
history.  During his prime he was a master trader of goods, but now
he's retired to his place of origin.  Trophies from his days of youth
are scattered about the walls, from the heads of rare animals to jars
of strange liquids.  A large desk in the far back of the room is in
neat order, with papers stacked perfectly on the wooden top.  Kabrok
smiles at you, glad to see that you wish to talk with him.

Massive doors block your way east.  Unlike other rooms in the
palace though, these ones are locked.  No amount of magic will be
able to get you through here, as an aura of enchantment oozes from
the gold.  The initials "K.  E."  Stand out in big gold letters, most
likely standing for "King of Elvandar".  Maybe this is where he
sleeps, but then again maybe the King is just trying to hide
something from curious eyes.

This is well, the grand kitchen.  It's nothing impressive, just a
lot of iron ovens, plain stuff and more plain stuff.  The king has
never stepped foot in this room I bet since it lacks the tacky decor
fo the rest of the palace.  One must wonder...  Where does all the
waste go from the kitchen when they're done?  Well in the back corner
there you can see a piece of glass, and looking through the glass you
see..  A big hole in the ground?!  How did THAT get there??

The audience chamber is a lot larger than it seems.  Ceilings
reach high into the shadows, lost above the blaze of torches. 
Corners are smothered in darkness as well, as if the torches subtle
glow cannot penetrate into the black heart.  A large, rounded table
surrounded by plain chairs fills the centre, while a throne as lavish
as the one in the ballroom has been errected.  In the corner, a small
elf sits at a tiny desk, shuffling papers and coughing slightly from
the chill in this room.

Those who might not exactly follow the law.  It is warm and very
stuffy, a smoke haze fills the air as if it was recently used.  Hey

a gold chain and a flashy suit.

Sleeping Chambers of the Elvandar King~
Normally this is where the king of Elvandar sleeps, but as you can
tell from the pristine condition of the room it is rarely used.  The
furniture sparkles brightly, without any dust, the velvety soft
sheets on the four poster bed look as if to be unslept in for days. 
The room itself is eerily quiet, you cannot seem to hear anything
inside here.  Most likely the magical barrier that encompases the
room is responsible for that.  Lying on the bed is a beautiful elven
pendant, perhaps given to the King by a lover.  Who knows?

A narrow, high ceiling hallway ends abruptly at a dead end,
fooling you into believing it went further from the darkness present.
Infact, there are only two doors present.  The words "President" have
been elegantly written in gold script upon the front of the northern
one, while the one mirroring it, plain and nondescript have the words
"Vice President" hastily scrawled in black ink.

This is the President's office.  He is the one who handles the
small matters of Elvandar that the king doesn't need to trouble
himself with.  He thinks he has power but he really doesn't.  In the
corner, a cute elven secretary busies herself trying to fix her
blouse, as if you just stumbled onto something not quite
appropriate..  The office is kept in pristine order though, and is
covered in entirely too much gold.

A mere shadow of the president, nobody really knows what the vice

glasses.  His office, or rather the janitor's closet is cluttered
with papers and cleaning tools.  A mop is acting as a coat hanger,
while a bucket holds his pens and pencils.  The desk itself is merely
a piece of board held up by stacks of books.

The city is more secluded and peaceful here, away from the noise and
