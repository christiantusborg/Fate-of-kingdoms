{WA {bb{Dlac{bk {Wboar{x~
A wild black boar snorts and scrapes the ground with his hoofs.
~
A big black boar is wandering around this patch of field grazing
on the long green grass.  It snorts every once in a while and shakes
its head, flies buzzing around its head and making it twitch its
ears.  It's not a cute animal, but despite its tusks, it doesn't seem
dangerous, and in fact kind of peaceful.

An old, blind beggar~
A poor, helpless beggar is wandering around, begging for change.
~
This poor soul is wandering around town, a blindfold covering his
eyes and a chipped ivory beggar's cup in his hands.  His back is
hunched over from years of misuse, and it seems like the only thing
that would give this guy a break is the day he finally kicks the
bucket.

An old man is leaning against the lift track, flipping a silver coin in the air.
~
This man is a retired soldier who happened to get his hands on a
broken lift carraige, and had the smarts to fix it and set it up in a
back alley of the stomping ground that is the southwestern section of
the Crossing.  He charges 500 gold for transportation, and holds the
key to the cage on a heavy key ring, clinking from his belt.  He
smirks at you as you come in, flipping a silver coin into the air,
ready for your business.

This is disgusting.  Omfg.  It's crawling out of a corpse, and has
about 15 layers of teeth in its circular mouth.  It looks like some
kind of mix between a leech and a craw worm.  You can't spot its
eyes...  It seems like the only thing about it is its mouth.  Acid
drips out of its mouth as it hisses at you, making it clear that it
wishes you were a corpse too.

Hovering in front of you is a wraith made out of sparking, pure
energy.  Its form shifts in and out of reality, and its phasing makes
it hard to hit with a weapon.  It is wearing a round mask with a wide
smile painted onto it, and is floating around the room aimlessly. 
Its hand reaches out at you, and you feel a shock run through your
body, and you begin to twitch.

The bartender's name is Anita, and she's very pretty.  Her hair is

Skrall~
A young urkan male dressed in a blue button up branzoire shuffles back and foreth, practicing his fencing.~
Above the black scales of his scorpion body, this is what appears
to be a teenage boy, black hair hanging into his eyes.  He shuffles
back and foreth across the room, practicing the footing for his
fencing, and seems to challenge you slightly as he notices you.  You
get the distinct feeling that you are the first one he has ever seen
with only two legs!

Skrala~
A luxurious urkan female stretched out across a velvet couch.~
This particular urkan looks a bit higher class than the others. 
She isn't wearing a shirt, and her chest and cherry-red lips would be
rather attractive if it weren't attached to a many-legged scorpion's
body.  However, her gaze is quite infatuating, and you feel yourself
drawn to her, despite your racial differences...

A dressed-up hallway~
This hallway is a little more fancy than the others.  A red carpet
with exotic designs lays out a path towards a room at the end of the
hall, before which a maid waits for the lucky customer who stays in
the best room in the inn.  Nonetheless, this hallway is still a
little thin, but the lighting is still excellent.

The Kvaja Bar & Grill~
Glossy lamps are all around, but this room still seems a little
dimly lit.  The walls are lined with framed pictures of local heroes,
and signed endorsements from some of them about how good the food and
drink here is.  Kvaja certainly seems to be the popular bar and inn
around here, and it's really no wonder.  The atmosphere is light and
outgoing, and even the most outcast of people could probably have fun
in here.

Gin and Tonic                               300 silver
  Mmm, that's a mighty fine gin and tonic.  We blend
  the finest imported gin with the finest imported
  tonic to make the finest Kvaja gin and tonic (with
  a little squirt of lime just for flavour!)
 
High City Absinthe                         1000 silver
  Coming all the way from the second tier of our
  good city is this glorious green liquid, spiked
  by wormwood, angelica root, hyssop, corriender
  seeds, caraway seeds, cardomon pods, and fennel
  seeds, picked from the desert farms.  Harsh!
 
White Russian (Double shots only!)          300 silver
  So chocolatey and creamy that it almost melts out
  the taste of the vodka within, it's hard not to
  enjoy drinking this.  Anita's special mix!
 
Goblet o' Rum                               400 silver
  Yo ho ho, here be our pirate juice!  9 out of 10
  scalleywags prefer our brew over any other on the
  seven seas.  Nicely amber coloured.
 
Iced Milk                                   200 silver
  Only the baddest of baddies drink the infamous
  brew known as "iced milk."  Do not pick a fight
  with the man with this on his bar counter, for you
  may get a lot more than you bargained for!
 
 
 
     (For the food menu, please look at menu2!)

A suite fit for a king~
Score.  This is the best room in the inn.  Everything is cleaned
to perfection, every surface wiped down until the last speck of dust
is gone, every cushion washed and fluffed thoroughly.  It smells like
roses in here, and you realize it is because the bed is covered in
rose petals.  This is the good life.

An ambrosial garden~
A shelf of sandstone steps leads down into the abbey's garden,
which is full of blossoms of all colours.  Four sheer paths lead out
in the cardinal directions from a wellspring in the garden's center,
and within the four sections are different grasses and blooms of blue
and purple, orange and red, yellow and green, and white and grey... 
The dull ringing of bronze church bells fills the air, coming from
the north.  Unlike the city in which this temple lies, it is very
peaceful here.

You are in the northeast section of a battle arena, the boundaries
of which are made up of a circular wall of spiked, chalky yellow
bones!  All around you are blood splatters and paths where bodies
have been dragged off of the sandy arena floor.  Aside from those,
the floor is marred with the hooftracks of galloping horses, scorched
patches where wizards have undoubtedly fought, and large claw marks,
undoubtedly made by the stronger of the beasts in this colluseum.

You are in the northwest section of a battle arena, the boundaries
of which are made up of a circular wall of spiked, chalky yellow
bones!  On this side of the wall you can spot several places where it
is almost broken, some from mighty fist marks, some from monsters
just plain throwing combatants against the wall.  It has been
repaired several times but in the upper reaches of the bones one can
still see the outline of where a giant scorpion was thrown through
the bone wall and into the seats.

You are in the southeast section of a battle arena, the boundaries

close to the wall, undoubtedly a prisoner crucified for the pleasure
of the audience, especially judging by the cruel amount of objects
strewn about the cross' base, thrown at him as he was dying.

You are in the southwest section of a battle arena, the boundaries
of which are made up of a circular wall of spiked, chalky yellow
bones!  Hundreds of tracks lead out from the gate to the south, where
the monsters are released from.  An enthusiastic young spectator
leans over the spiked wall from the amphitheater boxes and cheers as
the creatures stampede out of the gate, hissing and snarling
ferociously, and he nearly falls, before being pulled back above the
edge by an amphitheater guard.

Behind a burnt out building~
Behind a burnt out building is a secret of the barrio that not too
many know about.  A dirty metal platform is made up of not much but a
rusty metal grate and a lift track, blackened from use with no
maintenance, running up through the pipes and beams to the second
tier.  However, despite the conditions of the track, the cage sits at
the bottom, suspended from a heavy chain, and appears to be ready to
work.  The owner of this device is probably much more persuasive than
the guards at the other lifts.  
 
{Rlift cage vnum is 60148
the mob delay needs to be fixed.  look to ruined space port for answer?

{DInside the lift cage{x~
{WIt's very cramped in here.  You sit on a plank of metal as the
cage door closes behind you, and wait for the lift to tote you up. 
The smell of rust and gunk prevades the carraige, and between the
occasional jerking of the cage and shrieking of the moving chain,
you're beginning to have second thoughts about giving that man your
money - or even coming here at all.
 
But for now there is nothing you can do but sit and wait, and pray
the chain doesn't snap...{x

An empty platform~
At the top of the lift track is an empty platform made of
blackened steel, where one can step out into what appears to be a
vacant alley.  The vertigo from looking down is really incredible... 
There is a drop straight to the bottom, through spiderlike steel
beams and reinforcements, that would mean certain death to anyone who
happened to lose their balance and fall from this narrow platform. 
Be careful...

Crossing Lesser Fist Bridge~
The bustle of people is very heavy on this bridge!  It is much
wider than the others and full of carts and commerce.  There's even a
merchant riding an elephant across it, not even testing the bridge's
strength.  Merchants and fisherman are crossing this as fast as they
can, creating a huge bustle.  You can tell that the trading heart of
this town lies to the south.

The front hallway~
As you enter the mansion, the door closes behind you slowly, and
you realize that unlike the outside of the building, the interior is
dark and unkempt, almost as if it had been trashed on purpose.  You
look behind you at the door you came in through, and a chill runs
down your neck as you realize that this side of the door is caked
with dried blood.  Turning your back to the awful sight, you look
forward into the rest of the house, wondering whether it would be
wise to proceed.

The front hallway~
The hallway splits in two here, and you are confronted with a
magnificent banner on the wall, singed at the edges and ripped down
the middle.  The banner's size is astounding to begin with, but the
intricacies of the painting are also very eye-catching...  It is the
depiction of a battle between two enormous armies, one consisting of
the hardy warriors of the desert and the other of the plains'
horseback riders.  Each has sustained great losses, but the warriors
of the desert, the human army, seem to be overcoming the riders
through tactics and usage of bows and arrows.  A plaque under the
painting titles it, "The Age of War."

The front hallway~
The hallway continues here, collapsing on one side so that some
sun is shining through.  The ceiling is black and burnt, with stretch
marks reaching across it to show how it fell.  Splintered wood is all
over the floor, and each step arouses another little whirlwind of
sawdust and grime, making it difficult to breath.

The front hallway~
This is the southern hallway of the mansion.  It is as dank and
dusky as the rest of the place.  To the west is a black metal rack
molded in the shape of ivy leaves, growing from the floor to the
ceiling.  Through this you can see the remains of a young man's room,
mostly signified by the proud mounting of the Crossing's warrior's
seal above the room's sliding door.  To the east, the hall continues.

A dimly lit hallway~
On the south wall, the banner continues.  It depicts a crowd of
humans bowing before a mighty King, with sceptre raised high.  His
crown is gleaming, and he is wearing blessed armor which glimmers in
the sunlight, with a tower shield at his side.  All around him are
generals, staring at him with fierce dedication and exuberance.  The
King looks at the viewer with a piercing gaze.  This painting is
labeled, "The Ruler."

A dimly lit hallway~
On the north wall, the banner continues.  This depicts a town with
twisting roads and tightly knit neighborhoods, houses right next to
each other, stopping as soon as it hits the sand.  All around is
construction...  Beams are being raised and gigantic supports are
being constructed to support what must be a second level platform,
not unlike the tiers of modern-day Crossing.  Also, large turrets
with archers' slits all around are positioned in a circle around the
town, and there seems to be movement to construct city walls between
them.  This painting is labeled, "The Construction."

The library~
A dead man is leaning back in a large reading chair next to the
bookcase, head slumped to the side.  He is holding a book in his
hands, but the pages are doused in blood which leaked out of his slit
wrists.  His face is not decomposed, but pale and drained, with
nothing missing but his eyes.  The rest of his body is covered in a
blanket, also drenched with his blood, and there is an odd protrusion
from his stomach, seemingly the butt of a sword.

The tunnel ends here with a big wooden door, bound by metal bars. 
Through a single slot in the door, an overwhelming scent of death
wafts through, making you reel back with disgust.  The door is still
in tact enough to open.

The Cellar~
The wall is crumbling away to the north and you can smell the
musty scent of old water wafting in from the corner.  Knocking away a
few clumps of dirt, you see that there is a hole large enough for you
to pass through if you like, although some of the broken shards of
rock lining the hole are going to make it a little difficult. 
Nonetheless, it can't lead to anything worse than where you are now.

A dusty room~
Behind the trellis is a nearly pitch black room, with weapons and
toys alike strewn about the floor.  A broken bed frame is in the
corner, and a bookcase with no shelves stands by the door, leaned up
against the rack, the trellis' black paint seeping into its back. 
This room smells dankly of gunpowder.

An abandoned nursery~
Dust is covering everything here.  Most of the furniture is
smashed or destroyed, save for a dresser that lays up against the
wall with all its drawers open, with clothes hanging out like someone
had mussed through it all looking for something.  Another broken
piece of furniture catches your eye in the corner.  Walking over to
it, you see that it is a broken cradle, with something ins--oh, god,
it's a baby.  The dagger that killed it is still crammed through its
tiny chest, and its head is slumped back with a stream dried blood
running back out of its mouth.  Whoever did this was brutal and
merciless in their killing...  Nothing was spared.

A closet under the staircase~
This seems to have been a broom closet at one point, judging by
the rotting cleaning utilities strewn about the room.  There is
really nothing interesting here except a barren wooden plank in the
corner, which, albeit not very interesting by itself, seems kind of
out of place.  Upon further investigation you discover that there is
a very narrow hollow below it, that you could barely squeeze into if
you wanted...

The floor here is covered in sawdust and splintered wood.  Looking
up at the chasm, you see only darkness...  Halfway down the walls of
it disappeared, and turned into the black rock that makes up the
ceiling of this dark cavern.  Hisses of evil come from all around,
and you realize you have fallen into a den of malevolance and ruin...

Your light seems to be drowned out by blackness here, and your
vision can't make anything out...  Not even how big or small the room
is.  It seems like the only light is the dim beam shining down on you

This is one of the uppermost rooms in the thieves' guild.  It
doesn't seem to be a shop or a practice room...  In fact, it seems to
be a shelter for various homeless thieves who have nowhere else to
go.  It is very cluttered, and most of the furniture is partially
broken or blackened by pyromaniac rejects from society who have
stayed here in the past.

Anji's bedroom~
This is the topmost room in the house, with a round window to look
out over the town green.  Down there the bustle is always going,
people going from shop to shop selling or buying wares, but up here
everything is quiet.  This room was an attick before it was made into
a bedroom, and it shows by the low triangular ceiling, and the hard
wooden floor.  This is a very cosy place.

yell Mi'Kresh!  My own blood completes the ritual...my life...my death...is yours..!!
