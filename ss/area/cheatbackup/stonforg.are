The Path to Stone Forge~
As you approach the foot of Stone Forge mountain you notice a road
that snakes through parts of the mountain range itself.  As you
travel along the snakey path you notice to the south that the trail
leads to a single mountain peak.  As you get closer, you notice that
two large metal doors are built into the side of the mountain.

The Gates to Stone Forge~
After hours of traveling you finally reach the foot of Stone
Forge Peak and there you see two large doors.  These doors are made
from solid Mithril and have been crafted by the best dwarven
metalsmiths in Thera.  The doors open and close as travelers enter
and exit the city of Stone Forge.  Standing next to the doors are two
Elite Dwarven Defenders of Stone Forge.  They watch as people enter
and leave occasionally checking people's cargo.
A {csign{x is planted by the gates.

Intersection of Silver Street and Boulder Road~
As you pass through the Gate you are momentarily plunged into
darkness.  As your eyes adjust to the light you are amazed by the
sight that lies before you.  The Stone Forge spreads out before you
in a high vaulted ceiling cavern.  Even stranger to you is that the
city is lit by strange florescent lights.  Most of the buildings in
this city are hollowed out stalagmites.  To the north of you lies
Boulder Road and a large group of stalagmite that seem to have formed
some kind of a castle as well.  To the east and west lies Silver
Street.

undivided attention.  The man is telling the story of a dwarven
prince that fought the nasty dragon of Elvander.  The man is using
magic to supply a small sound and light show.  To the east you notice
a rather homely looking square building made of white marble.  When

these stalactites is dripping with water and has seem to have made a
rather interesting pond.  With the lack of stalagmites in the area
there are several people sitting here having picnics.  In front of
you the Garden continue and the site of another bridge can also be
seen.  Serenity lies all around you please enjoy your stay.

The Rock Garden~
Continuing along the path you come to a rather interesting place
in the Garden.  Someone has taken some artistic talent and decided to
carve furniture out of the stalagmites.  In several areas you see
chairs and table inwhich people are using them to have a light meal
on them.  The sound of laughter hits you as you notice a couple of
children playing in the area.  They appear to be playing tag of some
sort as the run amongst the carved stalagmites.  To your left lies a
bridge over a large chasm.  The picnic area lies back the way you
came.

On a Bridge~
As you cross the bridge you notice that this bridge is different
from the other one.  It appears to have some remnants of being
natural but patches of it are modern.  You inquire about it to the
first person you come across about the condition of the bridge.  The
person explains to you that a few years ago there was an earthquake
that hit Stone Forge and had damaged the bridge so they had to repair
it.  Your curiosity satisfied you continue across the bridge.  Back
to the north lies a picnic area.  Further to the south appears to be
some sort of peacefull resting area, made it would be a good idea to
check it out.

The Rock Garden~
Strolling along you come to a quiet part of the Garden.  Here
there are only a hand full of adults.  Most of the people you see are
lounging back on a stalagmite and are reading a book of some sort. 
While the rest appear to be enjoying a break from everyday life, even
going so far as to taking a nap.  The view from this point is breath
taking, to you right there is a wide open chasm that seems to reach
out forever.  The stalactites that hang out over the chasm have that
strange glowing moss that you saw at the entrance to the Garden.  The
light is reflected in a rather sporadic manner.  Given the chasm a
rather eery glow.  Back to the north lies a bridge.  To the east the
senerity of the Garden continues.

The Rock Garden~
Strolling along you come to a part of the Garden which puts you
in awe and at the same time freaks you out.  Someone has decided to
carve the stalagmites into the image of people.  The majority of the
people depicted are dwarfs but there are a few that from different
races.  As you continue to stare you notice that there are children
playing around the statues.  There are about 11 children in all and
they are playing a rather tiring game of tag.  They all run around
the statues chasing after each other occasionally one of them
accedentaly runs into a statue hurting him/her self.  The Garden
continues both to the east and west and to the north and south lies
two chasms.

The Rock Garden~
Slowing to a pace you continue your journey through the Rock
Garden.  Here the sound of water is very strong and it appears that
the source of the underground river is a rather large stalactite that
almost touches the ground.  The water has strangely enough carved a
crevasse into the stalactite allowing a controlled flow of water down
it.  The partons of the Garden appear to enjoy this part of the
Garden the most.  For this is the largest amount of people you've
seen yet in here.  To the north lies a bridge arcoss the chasm and
the Garden continues back to the west.

As you walk across the bridge you think to yourself, this is the
poorest dwarven stone work I've ever seen, but as you continue to
cross you notice that the bridge is natural.  As you reach the mid
point of the bridge you notice that the sound of running water is
coming from a river that is flowing underneath you.  As you walk
along you are greeted by others that are crossing the bridge.  To the
north of you lies the enterance to the Garden.  To the south you
notice a rather strange looking stalactite, maybe you should get a
closer look.

assuaalts your senses.  To the north of the shop is a multitude of
book cases that contains pills and bags of all sorts.  To your left
lies a large stone table where you see the usual short dwarven male
with almost complete white hair.  He is currently standing working on
some strange kind of concoction as you walk in.  He looks up at you
as you walk in and smiles and says, "Greetings Traveler."

As you finish crossing the chasm you stand before the mighty gates
of Stone Forge castle.  The gates to the castle are made of ten-foot
thick granite.  They are currently open and as you walk through them
you enter into the courtyard and are standing in front of Stone Forge
castle itself.  The doors into the castle itself are made from pure
mithril.  Standing before the doors are two dwarven Defenders.  The
courtyard stretches around the castle both to the east and west. 
Back to the south is the city of Stone Forge.

Walking around the castle you have reached the southeastern part
of the wall.  The southern and eastern parts of the castle wall meet
at a stalagmite perpendicular to each other.  The stalagmite has been
carved out so that Defenders can pass through it as well as use it as
a defensible position.  In this part of the courtyard several young
dwarfs that are either polishing armor or sharpening weapons.  Back
to the west lays the entrance into the castle.  The courtyard
continues to the north.

the castle.  Its smooth gray stonewalls appear to be unscalable. 
Waling through this part of the courtyard you see about ten dwarfs
they appear to be practicing their combat skills.  Some of them are
running around in full battle gear while other are just sparing with
nothing but their weapons and a shield.  The courtyard continues both

the cavern.  You notice that there is only one guard patrolling this
part of the wall.  The cavern wall appears to have been turned into
some sort of barracks for the dwarven Defenders.  There are very few
people on this side of the courtyard.  You see maybe a couple of
Defenders walk in and out of the barracks.  The courtyard continues
both to the south and west.

someone in the castle.  As you continue looking around you almost
walk straight into a ballista.  Startled you look around and notice
that there are several ballistae and a few catapults in the area you
have walked into.  As you look at each war machine you notice that
there is a small group of dwarfs running around doing maintenance on
the machines.  The courtyard continues both to the east and west.

smell a very strange smell.  Looking around you fin the source of the
smell.  You appear to have found the mess hall for the Defenders. 
The weird part is that I t is on the outside of the barracks.  There
are a couple of stone tables with Defenders sitting at them eating
their lunch.  The chief is cooking some strange concoction in a large
black kettle.  The courtyard continues both to the east and south.

of marching dwarfs.  The dwarfs in the formation are rather young
looking so you assume they are in training of some sorts.  As you
continue to watch you notice that they are rather well disciplined
for their age.  The drill instructor is a rather old looking dwarf. 
The Defenders patrolling the walls here are watching in amusement.

you hear they are talking about the mines being closed again, and
something about the third death this week.  Curious you try to find
the nearest Defender to you and when you ask they refuse to commit. 
Looking around you notice nothing else and continue on your way.  The
courtyard continues to the north and east.

The Main Hall~
Walking passed the large mithril doors, you have finally entered
Stone Forge castle.  You are standing in the main hallway of the
castle.  The floors of the castle are made from black marble and they
have red carpet laid out all over the place.  In the center of the
hallway is a large staircase that leads to the second floor of the
castle.  The railing on the staircase is made from white marble, the
stairs also have a red carpet that leads up them so that people do
not slip.  There are all sorts of serva running to a fore doing their
daily chores.  There are not guards anywhere to be seen in this room.
To your left lies the way to the mine lift.  To your right is the way
to the Treasury.  And the hallway snakes around the staircase to
continue on ahead of you.

As you take a right from the castle doors you walk into a large
area that has two large mithril doors at the end of it.  There are
two Defenders standing at these doors.  About twenty feet away from
the doors is a small wooden desk with a rather stingy looking dwarf
sitting behind it.  He must be the treasurer for the whole kind.  The
rest of this room looks like the Main Hallway.  The red carpet
becomes a circle, which surrounds the desk.  There are all sorts of
paintings on the walls, most of them are scenes of places you've
never been to.

the direct center of the room you see what must be a twelve-foot tall
bile of bag full of gold and jewels.  On the walls there is an
assortment of priceless paintings.  Tables lines the walls of this
room and you find on these tables a variety of goods.  One of the
things that attracts your attention is a suit of scalely red armor. 
There is a small plaque near the armor that has something written in
dwarven.  Too bad your dwarven wasn't so rusty or you could make
sense out of it.

As you take a left from the castle doors you notice that the red
carpet abruptly stops.  And the black marble floor no longer has its
polished gleam.  The walls are bare except for the occasional pike
axe hanging from the wall.  Along the walls you see miners that are
sitting on the ground waiting for something.  You go up to one and
ask what is going on he tells you that their waiting for the mines to
be opened back up.  Curious you look over in the direction of the
lift to the mine and see to Defenders talking with another miner.

to the lift to the mine.  There is a rope that is tie across the
entrance to the lift that says, "Mine Closed".  As you get closer to
the lift you are stopped by one of the Defenders.  As you slowly walk
away from the lift you catch a snippet of conversion from one of the
Defenders and a miner.  The miner is trying to explain to the
Defender that it is safe you go back to work in the mines.  But the
Defender shakes his head and tells the miner that by order of the
King that this mine is to stay closed.  Looking over at the lift you
curious about what the problem could be.

there you are impressed by the eloquence of the castle.  In this part
of the are even more servants running about.  To your left you notice
servant coming out of a room with trays of food and walking cross the
hall into the room on the right.  The room on the left must be the
kitchen and the room on the right must be some sort of dinning hall. 
But the room that peaks your interest the most is the one that lies
before you.  There are to stone doors that block your view into the
room.  But you notice that there are two Defenders standing beside
the door.  Hmmm...  That must be the way to the throne room.

You pass through the doorway and enter into a huge dinning hall. 
In the center of the hall is a large dinning table made of obsidian. 
At the far end of the table you can see where the King of Stone Forge
sits for his meals.  On the opposite end of the table there is no
place for sitting.  There must be something like fifty chairs to a
side on this table.  As you continue to look around you notice that
the staff is preparing the hall for a meal.  Eloquent porcelain
plates are being place on the table.  Next to the plates are stone
eating utensils, you subconsciously rub your jaw remember the last
time you ate with stone utensils.

prepared you like to yourself wow there are a lot of chefs in here.
You see at least six chefs and twenty cooks and unlike the chef
in the mess hall for the Defenders the chefs here are using normal
kitchen equipment.  There are all kinds of foods being cooked
anything from soups to sweet smelling desserts.  As you continue to
look around one of the chefs notices you looking around and tries
to hush you away but you deftly avoid him.

ceiling lighting the entire room.  The ground is covered with a thick
wealthy red carpet with beautiful designs on it.  The marble walls
are painted white and on them are hanged numerous paitings of ancient
noble kings of the Stone Forge that have once ruled.  To the north
are obsidian doors; both closed and by them is a dwarven figure
gazing at you constantly since you walked in.  Slowly he stands up,
glares at you for a moment and charges thrusting his blade in your
direction!  Beware!

of a black marble floor there is a white marble floor and the red
carpet still lies on the floor.  You are standing in the middle of a
three way interection.  Directly in front of you the hall leads down
to a rather modest looking door.  To your right you see several
people coming in and out of room down there.  And to you left lies
another strech of hallway that leads to a room, but there appears to
several people in robes down there waiting for someone.  And down
back the way you came is the main hallway for the castle.

front of you.  Along the walls of this stretch of hallway you see

see is of a father older dwarven fellow with an unusually short bread
and he's bald.  Back the way you came leads back to the staircase

seneschal is a man with good taste.  In his room you find a eloquent
four posted bed, when you sit down on the bed you find it is as soft
as a cloud.  On the other side of his room is a rather large sturdy
looking closet.  When you open the closets door you start looking
through the Seneschals clothing.  He has a rather weird taste in
clothing or maybe it's just what the dwarfs are wearing these days. 
As you continue to look around the room you notice that the Seneschal
has his own private bath.  On the walls of the room are various
painting of what you assume are family members or maybe great heroes
your just not sure.

what they are waiting for they say they are here waiting for the
King's head priest to give his sermon for the day.  Obviously these
are clerics of Mordin the World Forger.  You look towards the door of
the priest room and notice it is closed.  Also you look down at the
floor and notice that the carpet doesn't reach the full length of the
hall.  Behind you leads back to the staircase leading to the main

far corner of the room you see a small cot that the priest sleeps on
and to the right of it you see a peg on the wall that appears to hold
the priests only clothing.  Unlike the Seneschal's room the priest
doesn't even have his own bath instead in the opposite corner of the
room from the bed is a ordinary wash basin and small mirror.  How

flying everywhere.  Helping him pick up he's things you quickly
apologize and move on your way.  As you look along the walls you see
paintings of furious battles and occasionally you see a painting of
the King himself.  You notice that you are getting closer to a rather
interesting door.  The door has a face of a lion carved into it.  The
door itself is made of simple oak and there are servants walking into
and out of the room.  Curious about where the king sleeps you
continues forth or you can go back to the stairway and continue
looking around the castle.

assortment of clothing from everyday clothing to clothing for just
that special occasion.  And to your left lies the way to the kings
bath hmmm you wonder what kind of bath the king bathes in.  As you
continue to look around the room you see a multitude of servant

all together just cleaning up the room itself.

leaking water drops can be heard making little *splash*.  The tunnel
is dark and barely lit and you can see but little.  The ground is
rocky and peaples are scatted all around making walking hard as well.
A couple of dwarven miners are not far away chatting as they work.

The Throne Room~
As the doors to the throne room swing open you almost choke when
you see the insides.  The room slopes up until it reaches the center
of the room.  In the center of the room is a Throne made of solid
diamond.  You have never seen such a large diamond before in your
whole life, it must be worth millions of gold.  There is a set of
stair covered in a dark blue carpet leading up to the throne.  On the
walls there are paintings of battles long forgotten.  A large mithril
chandelier hangs from the ceiling creating a cone of light down on
the throne.  The King of the Stone Forge sits proudly on his throne.

Gold St.~
Continuing along Gold st, you notice less activity and noice.  You
are approaching the end of the street and it the crowd begins to
thin.  This looks more like a residential sector.  Little house built
side by side, each a replica of the other apart the painted color of
the doors, windows and such are crowded with large dwarven families. 
A few dwarven men are out of there houses arguing, yelling and
accusing each other of dumping garbage making the whole neirbourhood
stink.  A small sign saying "Ori's Training Fields, to the east" is
planted on the solid ground.

Ori Sandwrath stands at the end of the field waiting to engage you in
combat.  The cimented Gold St.  Ends up here, for the field is
covered with early.  A few practice dummies are installed at your
