animated corpse Garinthul~
The corpse of Garinthul~
The rotten body of a human is laying in the corner.
~
His flesh has rotted away in small splotches across
his body, revealing pale white bone beneath. His eyes
are gone, only sunken black holes remain. A small strap
of leather is wrapped around his waist, with a small satchel
tied to it. It looks as if he has been here an extended period
of time...

This figure is almost entirely covered by his white garb. Another
figure nearby is helping him learn to parry with a long dagger. His gaze is
intently focused on his trainer; he is intent on learning the skill.

In The Sewers~
It is now very dark, the only light source comes from a crack
underneath the door you came from, and it limits your sigh sig-
nificantly. You do, however, notice a very strong stench, what is
probably a mold or mildew of some kind, so powerful you can al-
most taste it as you breathe the stale air. While you stand on a 
hard surface of stone, all about you can be heard subtle drippings
and splashings of water, whose noises carry a long reverberated 
echo. The sounds seem to come from the north.

In The Sewers~
The darkness has let up a bit, leaving a twilight amount of
luminescence, but the smell remains. You no longer stand on
hard stone, but in half a fathom of smelly, dank water. Very
faintly, you hear a continous, echoing roar, from up ahead
of you. Also to your north, there are very small flickers of
light. Perhaps they are from torches, or even from the sun...

In View of Bright Lights~
The luminosity has increased still more, and a faint
shadow of your body flickers across the stone-pieced
tunnel you stand in. There is a small amount of force 
pushing at your feet from the water you stand in. As
you look ahead you see why. You realize you are standing
near the mouth of the tunnel, and ahead is a massive 
opening, where the water inside the tunnel flows out from.
You can continue still farther north towards the mouth of
the sewer.

Mouth of the Tunnel~
What you see now amazed you. You now stand in the mouth
of the tunnel, which ends in a truly massive vertical
column. Rings of torches line the interior of this column
about every 10 paces up to the unseen ceiling, and all the
way down to the bottom. There appear to be other tunnels,
like the one you stand in now, throughout the column at
various intervals, and on all sides. They are all gushing
water out of them, like small waterfalls, all the way to
the bottom. It looks to be no less than 100 paces to the
bottom of this massive room. A stone lip extends from the
side of the column by about 3 paces, making it possible to
traverse, if you are careful. The stone lip begins at your
right and left. Also, you notice the beginning of a ladder
fixed the bottom of the tunne, leading down toward the bottom
of the column. It's certainly difficult to keep your footing,
with the force of the flowing water is pressing still 
harder at your heels.

South of the Drainage Pool~
After the long climb down the ladder, you have found yourself
at last at the bottom of the massive hollow column. You stand
halfway between two of the cascading streams of foul water 
which roar from above you, all the way down into a large dark
pool of water in front of you. You can continue east or west,
if you avoid the torrents of water that come from above.

Southwest on a Stone Lip~
You have carefully stepped across to the southwest section
of this column. Lichen and moss have painted abstract pictures
on the stones of the inside wall in shades of green and black.
It would be easy to suffer from vertigo up here. You stand 
precariously on the lip, and looking over it, you see a long 
fall awaiting you should you happen to lose your footing. You
can continue to follow the long curve of the lip to your north,
or you can climb down the ladder that sits at your feet.

is another tunnel to your south, but the water flowing from it
is so strong, the currents of it would likely force you back out.

pool of water ahead of you and to your left. It looks safe to
proceed farther, as long as you hug the wall and avoid the 
waterfalls. There is a smaller tunnel behind you, but it seems
a large pile of stones blocks most of the entrance. You could
likely find a way in, if you looked hard enough...

A Small Alcove~
You breathe a sigh of relief, being off the stone lip and
onto the security that solid ground has to offer. You now stand
with a small stone alcove, the ceiling of which almost touches 
your head as you stand under it. It is certainly hard to see from
the lip, and though it is constructed of the moss-covered stones,
something seems... different. There is a large discoloration in
the stonework before you. Also, the stones there seem not to
be covered in any sort of moss or lichen...

A Hidden Room Behind the Alcove~
You step through the opening in the wall, and find yourself
in a small room with no exits save the one you came in. The 
north wall of the room has three torches burning, and the 
floor below it is covered with a large cloth or blanket. Strange
tools, or perhaps weapons, the likes of which you do not recognize,
are spread out amongst it. You suddenly notice a figure, in grey
cloak and hood, sitting next to them, his back to you. Your hand on
the hilt of your weapon, you approach him...

A Small Cave~
It is rather dark in here, but by the light from the torches
of the columns, you can see that you are in a small cave. Several
stone tools lay near the wall to your right. Likely the stone here
was used to make repairs in the column. The cave continues to your
south.

Back of the Cave~
It is darker still here, as you tread farther from the light of
the column. Several markings decorate the walls of the cave here,
and many of them must be very old, for they are eroded almost
beyond recognition. One of the etchings, written in the modern
toungue, catches your eye. It reads, "Garinthul, humble servant
of Sierus and master alchemist of the known Thera, have come to
what seems is the end. This is at last end of my days, for its
power has grown too strong for me. I feel myself changing... 
fading... I only pray that whoever may find this flee from this
place, before the power of either it or the one who holds
it should find its way to you..."
It seems Garinthul didn't live to finish much more. There are 
markings on the floor, in the shape of two rings, one inside the
other. There is a large diamond placed inside the inner ring. Also,
you notice, there is a symbol that matches it on the ceiling...

Inside the Blocked Tunnel~
Crawling through the narrow opening of the cave ceiling brings
you into the tunnel that you previously could not enter. The same
blockage of stones covers the mouth of the tunnel, behind you. 
Ahead of you a single torch burns softly on the wall, threatening
to go out any moment. Below the torch, only half a pace from the
floor, are 4 carvings, of what seems is a progressive event.
The first shows a human, with a diamond shaped stone above its
head. The second shows surges of lightning or some other type
of energy running from the stone to the human. The third depicts
the human, laying on the ground, presumably dead, with the stone
in the air above its body. The last illustrates the human as a
skeleton, rays of energy coming from its animated body. Strangely,
the last carving lacks the presence of the stone shown in the first
three. This tunnel continues, taking a sharp turn to your east.

End of the Tunnel~
You are at the end of this tunnel. The tunnel ends in a small
room with cave-like features. Toward the back of this room is a 
ladder leading farther into the earth. Laying upon the floor in
the back corner is a skeleton, almost surely of human origin. 
Clutched in its skeletal hand is a small bag. Laying near it
legs is a chisel. Perhaps this is what remains of Garinthul...

Beneath the Tunnel~
It is shockingly brighter down here. Torches line the wall
every few paces, illuminating your surroundings amazingly well.
Unfortunately, there isn't much to see. The ground is hard
clay, and the walls seem comprised of a mix of gravel and
dirt. There are two passageways leading both to your north,
and to your east. There is a wooden sign crookedly stuck
into the clay at the corner of this intersection.

Thom's Bazaar~
There is a counter here, which Thom stands behind, and
it seems to be carved from only one piece of stone. It 
extends a considerable distance to your west, where another
figure awaits behind a counter. Several objects and oddities
line the wall behind Thom, and the shelves above him hold
everything from arrows to casks of water. Thom stares at
you, and looks as if he doesn't care who you are, as long
as you buy something.

Murvin's Enigmas~
The view has certainly changed as you come to this half of the
counter.  Against the wall behind Murvin are several different
colored staffs, and the shelf above them holds many small vials, the
contents of which vary in color.  Many rolled up parchments lay
stacked one upon the other, and wands are hovering by some unseen
magic off in a corner of the shelf.  Murvin himself sits on a raised
chair, legs folded and eyes shut.  He does not make a sound, nor does
he move.  Perhaps you should just buy something and leave.

A Dark Clay Tunnel~
Heading east at the intersection brings you further down
the clay tunnel. The clay looks darker here, however, and
instead of the normal brown the clay is almost black, as if
from contamination. Even the torches on the walls here seem
to burn a darker red. This tunnel continues to your east, or
west back to the intersection.

Among Ancient Stones~
The clay of the walls is thinning out here, but many
stones, which appear almost as old as Thera itself, 
have created the walls here. Where you stand the walls
are infused with both a dark clay and these archaic stones.
Ahead you, to your north, there is a room, and it also seems
completely comprised of these same stones.

A Degraded Stone Room~
Now at the end of the passage, you are in a room
made entirely of ancient stones stacked upon each
other. The room is not terribly large, but its size would
allow it to easily house one hundred people. There are
eight cots in this room, four along the wall both on your
left and right. There is a certain morbid feel to this room,
perhaps it comes from the blood stains on the sheets of the
cots, or from the crude looking tools hanging from the wall up
ahead of you. There is an exhasted looking orc posted on a
stool in the back corner of the room, near all of the hanging
tools. You can rest here among the spots of blood, or head
back the way you came.

Guard Room~
You are now in a small room.  The walls are constructed
of old mason stones, and sand has leaked through some
seams in the stones. There is only one other door in this
room, to your north, and a rather stern-looking guard stands
next to it. There is also a door to your south, which you came
through. Two torches, one on either side of your, burn brightly,
casting your shadow against the wall, and they flicker from the
air that is pushed through from under the door.
