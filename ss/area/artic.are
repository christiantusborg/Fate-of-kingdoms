they lived in the cold and knew how to survive well.

A Snow Covered Path~
{x Slowly approaching what appears to be a small village with
small and steep hills, small villa cabins covered with snow and
stacks of light gray smoke loft into the air.  A very covered path
lays to the city, covered always with fresh white powder, but a
barely visible track being seen of boots and horse tracks.  A few
bare trees or pine trees line this small path scarecely, usually a
dark gray sky leans over this quaint town.

{x The path of snow slowly clears out to a large brick wall, half
covered by snow and almost ground level to a large hill that
stretches up on either side of the ground covered with white powder. 
A few pine trees sit up atop of those hills.  Parts of the ground are
covered with burried potatoe sized and shaped brick like rocks which
lead to the small cabins of the quant little winterlined village.

Inside Gintid the Winter City~
{x What a strange place to put a small village, very small and
cold.  Snow falls over the roofs where chimneys must lay, smoke
stacks just jutting out of the pointed roofs, where gray clouds of
smoke poof out.  A small set of gray bricks lay on the ground, where
snow lay between the rounded slippery bricks, stairs and cross overs
lay on the barren town, obviously not too far north as a few bare
trees are scattered around.  A soft jingle and buzz goes through this
peaceful and quiet city, though many travelers keeps quite still.

{x This is one of the first streets, close to the entrance of the
entire town with a gray silvery potatoe brick road closely packed
also with the white snow which falls from the dark skies.  Along the
roads are little cylander hut houses with other villa like buildings
stocked with chimneas and yellow glowing windows.  From the dark
skies where the gray smoke arises are lit along the ground with very
few tall black iron posts with curved lamps which glow and help
travelers pass.

{x The snow from above rain down from the cloudy and dark skies,
adding to the abundant pile of snow which lies left and right of the
brick stone path.  Many little cabins of stone and wood lay abundant
around these parts, with straw like snow covered roofs and lit up
windows with the lamposts to keep the town shinning.  Very few stood
outside, for the tempreture is frigid, so the bundled up folk try to
rush aside.

Intersection of Twilight and Twinkle~
{x Here, the two roads of twilight and the road of twinkle combine
into one, with a ritual mating o the potatoe brick sized roads, so
contemptly cleaned daily by the eager citizens.  Iron clad lamposes
keep the city lit up every day, and night, for the gray cloudy skies
did not offer much more light than a regular dusk would.  The snow
offers a light path throughout the entire city, ontop of every house,
sidewalk and tree.

higher ground with snow to see the very top of the mountain, covered
with snow clouds, and possibly a star or two from the highest point
without clouds.  Many lanterns on iron clad posts settle down twinkle
avenue to light up the dim road, and to make it venturable by the
citizens who care about the villa.

chimney.  {x Its wooden doors are always open, but do not leave them
open, the cold weather is enough to fetch any passerby ill.

the road in such a cold and dark town.

gray now frosted over with a thin layer of snow, usually plowed by
the commoners.  A few tall green pine trees grow up from the snow
covered frozen grass, near the wall which is up to another flat laer
of ground and snow.  Many little winter white buildings with brown
trims, sit here along the road, along with little round huts with
yellow glowing windows in the dark skies.  To the North is a sign of
a coat, which symbolizes the popular clothing store, which the people
are in need of.

buildings lie in this city, despite its cold tempreate, so each house
was equipped with a stone chimney, that warm gray smoke poured from,
keeping its occupants content.

with large buildings and a delicate look with a few green pines and a
few bare regular trees in the snowy grounds.  Many large buildings
line the Outside of the road next to the ground level and along the
inside road are more huts for more comfortable living.  Little
glowing lamps sit in most of the chimnea stacked huts, and to the
West is a very large hisotrical building made of wood and many large
bricks, which resembles that of a republical building, a long stretch
connected to a dome roofed building.  A large sign sits along the
potatoe bricked path which shows a set of swords and shields, giving
some interest to that building.

Twilight Street~
{x The cold and chilling winds blow through the entire village,
sweeping up a wave of light flufffy snow with it.  Snow covered the
entire city, with each one of it's streets, rooftops, and lushious
ever-green trees.  A soft chiming from a nearby windchime could be
heard as the wind tickles the musical wind ornament.  The houses
which line up and down the gloomy road are fine little villa cottages
with stone brick chimney tops, that gray light and puffy smoke pours
out.

{x What a delectable odor that comes from one of the large huts,
the smell of pastries and other related goods come from it, a few
large glass windows are shown with curtains.  Inside those windows
are displays of delicious and sweet looking cakes and many pies, it
is very tempting to go in from this cold snow covered path to a warm
building and get a meal.

Twilight Street~
{x The city of Gintid is a shy town to the north, filled with
dozens and dozens of little villa cottages made of a warm insulated
plaster with a thick log frame, almost every one of them.  The entire
city is in a steep hill but it cuts off at the snowy rooftop level. 
The skies are cloudy and gray, falling with snow a lot of the time,
allowing the heavy iron lamps to do their duty throughout the entire
town.

together in unity.  From the north can be seen beautiful mountains to
the north, enshrouded with the clouds and the aurora which shines to

dark.  The roads connectiong here are short, but fine and well kept
roads, despite the unpleasurable weather.

white and onto the gray city below, on the peaceful villa.  The sun
is blocked out by most of the mountain to the north, and the clouds

round potatoe shaped gray rock road with many white buildings linning
the sides, Behind them were large walls verticle to the ground with
much snow upon the roof, road and grounds.  The skies above here
everywhere which snow gently falls from the dark gray or blue skies,

street lamps.  To the North of Lantern road appears to be a small
store with a wooden sign which dangles above the wooden door, with

weather outside, who would?

bloodstained or worse, a few chunks of broken weapons or armor layed
scattered around the dirty floor, however cleaned once a week.  No

treats contained in this cabin.  Why need fireplaces when the whole
back store is aligned with many strange iron cast stoves which bake
constantly, displays upon counters or shelves of fresh food.  Most of
the store is wood, with a few windows which looks outwards to the
streets.  The outside seems gray compaired to the bright store.

been one of few to actually make it to the top, a small pleatu seems

clouds stand beside you enjoying the view down upon the smaller
mountains, and possible Gintid at the foot of the mountain, and
whatever city can be seen from the horizon.  The clearing is wide and
beautiful, haven fresh untracked snow, and a large exotic tree that
sits in the center of the clearing at the peak of the mighty
mountain.  Having seen this, it makes a proof that man can accomplish

jagged rock of grays and blues, covered with deep blacks of ice and
the whites of snow, painting a canvas along the North wall of rock
which seems to go up forever until hitting the clouds in a violent
jagged upturn.  Only snow lays in the clearing along with a single
evergreen tree that sits in the center, clinging to life.

A Mountain Path~
{x The path slowly continues along the long path as it tends to
move upwards into the air, for it is a very large mountain, with
vague paths of rocks and ice that guide through, although no actual
foot prints, for the snow conceals all.

cavern, a large opening in the side of the mountain large enough for
a tiny ogre to fit inside of.  Very little light enters or exits this
little hole in the mountain, so who knows what dwells within.

Inside the Cavern~
{D Within the cavern, still rather chilly from the snow which
blows in shortly from the breeze, the snow cuts off once hitting the
caven's grayish blueish frozen floor, which stalagtites and
stalagmites rest.  It is far too cold to live in for long, but so
much nicer then the ice outside.

in these parts from the stumps clean cut from a lumberjacks saw and

walls made of a thick set of linked logs and the floors made of thick

seems to be a massive hollowed out spiral made of ice, but unable to

keep this arena somewhat dim, and slightly of an odd odor.

Inside the Cages of Battle~
{x This room was more of a large few hundred foot stone area with
a barrier, the same large metal gate to the East and above head about
fourty feet was the set of spectators.  The floor was slightl
bloodstained or worse, a few chunks of broken weapons or armor layed
scattered around the dirty floor, however cleaned once a week.  No

Inside The Caves~
{x Here are some semi-dark caves, dank and cold, stone of gray
surrounding the small two horse sized caves, enough for a handful of
people.  However still cold, a few stalagtites and stalagmites and
icicles hanging around the entire cave.

The Mouth of a Cave~
{D This cave, somewhat containing another smell, that of just a
plain animal's odor though, slightly breezing through here, inside
the well isolated and insulated caves.  Even though still cold, it
blocks the harsh winds for enough for a domestic animal to live
inside.

Inside the Caves~
{D Ahh, the nice body heat or something is keeping these caves
slightly warmer than the other ones, despite the cold navy gray rocks
that surround in a come like cavern overcover, the edges are still
rather icy and jagged.  However some traces of animal smell and
animal fur lay here and there.

Inside A Bear's Den~
{D Ah, here is the focus of the animalistic smell, where the heavy
and well rounded jagged cave walls in a dome.  Possibly large enough
for a large creature to live here, and by the way straw and dead
rotted tree parts lay here in a nest like appearence, something does
live here.

The Lantern Shop~
{x How ironic that Lantern shop would be located by the lantern
road.  Business is doing fine, and so does the shop look in excellent
condition, with fine carpet and wood floorings with laterns set all
over the place.  For such a dark scenic area, it has made this shop
popular with tall iron posted lamps in the floor or on the window
with oil lamps or tiny candles.

The Blacksmith~
The Blacksmith store is a quite large store, appearantly below a
small house.  This floor however appears to be any normal store, with
a tall ceiling and blue walls, expanding around a large 40 diameter
room with a wooden floor.

The Jeweller Shop~
This is a small, beautiful furnished room.  The warm light
emanating from the small oil lamps on the walls is reflected in the
hard, polished surface of the big mahogany desk that stands in the
centre of the room.  Behind a big wooded desk stands a very beautiful
dressed lady.  A small sign with golden letters stands on the desk.
