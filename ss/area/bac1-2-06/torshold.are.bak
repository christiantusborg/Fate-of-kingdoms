Minotaur demon guardian torsanctus ~
A hulking minotaur~
{xA gargantuan {Dg{Wr{De{Wy {xskinned {RMinotaur {xlooms above you.
~
This minotaur is huge...  It must be at least 30 feet tall, and
just fits in the mouth of the cave which it is guarding.  Its grey
skin is marred by terrible scars, most notably of which is a magical
wound that's been seered all the way up its chest.  Its left eye is
glowing red and trailing smoke, the sure sign that it has been
possessed by a demon spirit.  The chain binding it to the ground is
proportional to its size...  Each link is about 3 feet in diameter,
and it strains against its bindings to get to you.

imp trarg miniscule alchemist potion~
Trarg the Imp~
A miniscule imp is sitting on a stool here, fiddling with tubes and flasks of bubbling potions.
~
Trarg is a small, nasty looking creature that stands at about two
and a half feet tall.  From its back sprout tiny wings that seem like
they would be incapable of flight, but obviously that is not true
beings that the imp IS flying.  Along with the wings it has two tiny
horns coming from its head, and little fangs that kind of make it
look like a tiny vampire.  Its skin is an olive green, with reddish
markings on its chest and face, and when you look at it, it seems to
shrink back into the room and try to hide.

A Torsanctian Warlock~
A tattood warlock is here organizing scrolls.
~
All the makings of a demonic summoner seem to be displayed in this
intimidating human.  His face and arms are tattooed up and down with
arcane symbols, and he carries a long staff on his back mounted with
a small golden skull.  He's wearing a tight sleeveless shirt and sits
behind a desk with his feet up, waiting for your purchase.

The Gatekeeper~
A trite looking blue skinned gentleman stands here, leaning on his cane and humming a tune.
~
This seems to be a somewhat refined gentleman.  He is dressed in a
clean black suit, complete with bowler hat, and leaning on a silver
cane.  He looks at you calmly and inquisitively, and you get the
feeling that he has been here for a very, very long time.

This man has a weight problem.  It's one of those things where you
look at him and go, how did that even happen?  He is sitting behind a
counter on top of two crates, stacked side by side.  You feel sorry
for the crates.  In any case, in order to get your daily meals, you
must buy them through this sweaty man, or learn to make them
yourself.

A slovenly ogre~
{xA slovenly {ROgre{x is here,awaiting your buisness.
~
Looking at this wreck, you wonder how he managed to be entrusted
with Torsanctus's humungous bank account.  His body reaks of alchohol
and rotting fruit, and he drools on himself, barely paying attention
to those who want to withdraw money.  Suddenly one of the goblin
slaves attending the pyramid tries to sneak into the doorway, and the
ogre leaps from his seat and crushes the slave's body in a massive
bear hug, then rips him in two!  You edge away from the banker,
understanding now perhaps too well why he landed this job.

~
This elf seems to be a slave, as she is bound to the floor by a
thin chain.  She is dressed in a long white robe, and her wavy blond
hair has been cut short as a sign of servitude.  She seems somewhat
unhappy about her situation, but has also clearly res igned herself
to her new life.  If asked, she will tell you that she was kidnapped
from the Holy Grove and held in captivity when the Coven discovered
her healing powers.

she was forced to wear or be naked.  Being abducted from Elvander by

Madison the {DH{Wa{Dm{Wm{De{Wr {xof {RT{rOR{DSANC{rTU{RS {xis
awaiting to crush and destroy any intruders which come into the
Crossway.  Long ago Madison was a guardian of the Temple of
Urrem'Tier which existed in a land far away from here.  After living
a long life of undying loyalty to the Temple and Urrem'Tier
Urrem'Tier, through the help of his servant Demonic Lord Uritel. 
Once again this giant lives on and serves solely as a protector of
the underground cavern of the demons of Torsanctus,as ordered by
Urrem'Tier.  About her body is nothing but a strap covering her chest
area,and a Huge BattleHammer which she holds with two hands,because
of its massive size.  About her waist is a large loin cloth which
covers her areas very well.  She has boots made of a thick leather
which are laced up to her knee's.  Madison sits here with her rank
superior "Fieres" ready to unleash a fury upon anyone who doesnt bear
the mark of the demon.

Standing before you is the Great "{RF{ri{Re{rr{Re{rs{x".  He
stands at a mere ten paces exactly.  His hair is the color of fire
and he bears not the usual mark of the demon combined with that of
"Urrem'Tier".  But bears the mark of Urrem'Tier alone about his
lightweight plate,with the symbols being beared on the frontside of
his plate and the backside.  Fieres looks as if he has been dead for
ages now,his eyes are missing and emitting a empty dark glow.  His
skin appears to smell with the stench of decay and rott.  He has been
ressurected to fullfill one purpose.  To protect the cavern of his
people, the coven of {RT{rOR{DSANC{rTU{RS{x.

The Mouth of a Gigantic Tunnel~
You stand before the mouth of a cave, probably about 40 feet tall
and 60 feet wide.  There is a huge minotaur chained to the ground
here, guarding the enterence to the tunnel, which continues back into
blackness.  A monolith stands here with the demonic symbol of
Torsanctus inticritely etched into it, with what seems to be blood
stains coloring the inside a dark red.  The grass here abruptly ends
and turns to scorched earth as it proceeds into the gaping tunnel,
which is obviously created by magical means.

The Summit of the Pyramid.~
This entire area is surrounded by a blue, pulsating energy field. 
You stand on the summit of the pyramid, which has been cut off at a
flat to create room for Uritel's garden.  Ferns and black flowers
adorn the short layer of grass that grows upon it, an d to the north
stands two huge monolithic altars.  Between them is an ethereal oval
of black abyss, which sparks black lightning-like charges between its
edges and the surrounding field of energy.  Looking into the abyss,
you see an endless array of twisting time and space which your mind
can barely comprehend visually.  It makes you dizzy, and you get the
feeling that whatever lies behind that portal is immensely demonic
and powerful.

A Demonic Regeneration Room.~
All around are symbols of demonic meaning and of the Torsanctian
kingdom.  It is very dark in here and the lighting is dim.  But its
quite obvious this is a good place to lay rest your body and heal
your wounds from battle.  An Elven Healer is here attending the
wounded and laying hands upon all.  She seems to be very unhappy
about something.  Maybe its because she is being held against her own
freewill.

The War Room of {RT{rOR{DSANC{rTU{RS{x~
Torchlight flickers softly on this rooms stone walls from two
torches above the doorway to the south.  In the middle of the room is
a large rectangular table, surrounded by high-backed wooden chairs. 
The one at the head of the table is the largest, and seems to belong
to the Demonic Lord.  It is here that the members of the Coven gather
to discuss matters of war and peace...  Who to kill and who to leave
be (for now).  On the table is a map of Thera, which is slowly
gaining more and more Torsanctus occupied cities.
