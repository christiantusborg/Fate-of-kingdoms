Desc Standing before you is a male elf.  He stands around 11 hands tall
and weighs approximately 45 stones.  Zaeleir is stocky and has very
well-defined muscles.  His face is round with sharp cheek bones that
bring out the jagged sockets hiding his eyes, dark blue eyes filled
with mystery.  His nose is large for the size of his face while not
being too obtrusive.  Just under it, his mouth is surrounded by
wrinkles that gives it the impression of a constant frown jet black
hair standing straight up from his head about half a hand or so
reveals the large size of his ears.  A shyness pervades Zaeleir's
appearance, possibly because of the way he carries himself.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Some months ago, maybe years, a young elf was born in the city of
Elvander.  His parents couldnt be more proud of their new child, such
a beatiful child he was.  Zaeleir they named him, after his father,
and his grandfather.  Already as youngster, Zaeleir showed his
interests in magics.  Unlike anyone else in his family, Zaeleir was
really interested in the magics of the mages.  His father, a druid,
tried as hard as he could to teach his son some magic.  But Zaeleir
was not interested in what he had to teach him.  So he walked all
over the town, trying to find someone who could help him teach mage
spells.  Many a mage he found, but none willing to teach their
techniques.  For a couple of months, all Zaeleir had was himself.  He
would go to the forest, sit down on the ground, and concentrate
deeply on some very easy magic.  And everytime he succeeded. 
Allthough all the spells was very easy to learn, it made Zaeleir very
happy to being able to do them.  One day, while trying to make
mushrooms in the forest, a very old man approached him.  "I see you
are very skilled in the easy forms of magic, young elf", the man
said.  "Thank you, I've been doing it for a while now, and Im a fast
learner.  I also try to come up with some new harder spells to cast",
Zaeleir replied.  "Go explore the High Tower of Sorcery, my friend. 
There you will find many mages , many skilled mages, they will teach
you what you want to know.  And what you need to know.  With their
help, I know you will grow up to be a very skillful mage.  You got
what it takes to learn, and Im sure you will do anything to learn it.
When you have learned everything you can from the mages there, come
seek me.  I will show you the mages best secrets.  Powers no one have
ever seen for a long, long time.  So, go now elf, go.  I will use my
magics to keep an eye on you and your teaching."  Zaeleir noded
sagely, and left back to town.  His journey now goes to Sanaria, then
he needs to ask people for directions to the High Tower.  Coming back
to Elvander, Zaeleir rushed in his house, packed a few lembas, a
water bag, and wrote a goodbye note to his parents.  His first day of
his journey was almost over.  In the middle of nowhere he now was.
