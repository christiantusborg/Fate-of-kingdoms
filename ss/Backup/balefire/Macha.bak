Desc Here stands before you, a rather crude human-ish figure covered in
a rough sickly green leathery hide.  A pair of gleaming tusks
protrude from a crooked maw, one chipped the other broken and haggard
looking.  Dull yellowish eyes set above a small pig-like nose stare
blankly about.  Long tendrils of a bluish black color extend upwards
and droop from their weighty-ness. A well muscled neck trails
downward to a rather bulky torso, and an obscene though not out of place
pot belly.  Large brutish limbs thick like tree trunks hang loosely
graced with a giant "paw", which serve as hands nails dirty and
cracked.  Below this a pair of Short and stout legs standing strongly
on the solid earth.

Back There are very few who can speak of Theran History without meniton
the proud orcs.  The presence of the orc people dating back to near
the begining, and thick as their hide.  No one seems able to agree on
the true origin or their true intentions.  When the word orc is
spoken many think of the voracity and the cruelty of a race.  A
civilization built upon the ideals of war or so it is believed.  To
those who delve deeper they find an almost odd way of life.  Taken by
urges of pillaging like a ragtag band of mauraders which often leads
to their vulgar reputation.  They prize strength of all sorts and the
ability to endure, which may explain their affiliation with other odd
sorts like trolls and ogres.  Their way of life is simple and often
actions taken for the good of the tribe.  One such tribe is where we
begin our tale.....  
 
Amongst the tribe there is many ranks which often are lost in the 
teachings by a biased student. Orcs amongst the lowest of the low mere
cannon fodder, most of them unthinking brutish warriors who think not
for themself. There is Hunters, often mistaken for the brutish raiding
marauders these sorts are not so simple. Smarter then many of the orc 
ranks in their ability to think and do good for the tribe. Above the 
hunter stands two others, Shaman and chief of the tribe. Both more
complex then most realize but also more simple then that of other 
race's hierarchy. These ranks keep order amongst the orc, even if 
this order is often cruely dubbed chaos by others.
 
This story begins the tale of our unlikely wanderer, his name Macha
holding no meaning amidst the common or orcish tongues. Merely an
orc who follows a rather odd path. A warden of the forest but a 
hunter amidst the tribe ranks. A path which has led him far into the
deepest reaches of the forest. It was here he would lose his way back
to the village like so many other times. Lacking a sense of direction
is often folly for any creature. Wandering amidst the green lands
he did discover the hidden bounty of the forest mother and of her
children. Where or when he came across his most unlikely allies is
still unknown but it seems in times of need the bushy tailed rodents
big or small come to aid. By chance the lost orc occasionally stumbles
back to the tribe bearing gifts from the land, but those chances are
rare indeed in the distant travels. With the recent happenings in 
Thera only one thing can be for certain at this time.....Nothing will
stay the same as it once was.....
