Desc A Duergar, standing about 3 feet tall.  His eyes are as black as
night.  His hair, a strange color of deep blue that blends to the
shadows.  He is very muscular for his size, looking in all to weigh
about 220 stones.  His skin is a pale white, seeming whiter then it
should due to his dark hair.  Yet it has a blue gleam to it.  Tattoos
covering his body give off the glow.  Strange symbols, dug deep into
the skin, and filled with a eerie ink.  He has long slender fingers,
perfect for an assassin, and treads lightly on his otherwise huge
feet.

Back No one knows where Izuzu originated from.  It is said that he was
born of the very Earth that is Thera herself.  His mother the land,
his father a divine, yet corrupt, spirit.  His childhood is lost to
the world.  Known only to himself.  All that can be assumed about him
is that his childhood may have been a rough one.  His body lined with
scars and tribal tattoos.  But childhood is where the assumptions
end.  Izuzu made somewhat of a name for himself years ago.  He
brought about the destruction of many kingdoms, not with brute force,
for such a move is not the way of a duergar, but by cunning plan. 
High profile political assassinations..  Destruction of the kings and
heirs that keep a kingdom running smoothly bring down such figures,
led way for civil wars, economic destabilization, as well as greedy
thugs and warlords taking over the kingdoms without a fight, and
running them into the ground.  Yes...  Izuzu was magnificent at his
craft.  Yet once again..  This is where history goes blurry.  His
training, unknown, his teacher, once again unkown...  Almost as if he
sprung from the ground, able to kill.  Years after he took up such a
profession, Izuzu disappeared from the face of Thera, sightings of
him came here and there, clear a crossed the land, and then to the
other side.  It is said that he was bored of his work, but most knew
better.  For those who knew better, they assumed that he was looking
for a challenge, or even followers.
