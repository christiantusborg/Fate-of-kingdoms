Desc Here stands a interesting being.  He stands about 6 paces high,
looking to weigh about 210 stones.  He carries himself well, baring
little visible scars.  His skin is nearly milk white, and his hair as
yellow as the sun.  He dons the full mustache of a Paladin proudly,
letting all know he belongs to the order.  His eyes are a deep blue. 
He is supported by a lean, well toned body.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  Mikael was born to a
poverty stricken family in the inner slums of Sanaria.  There was no
noble lineage in his blood, so no secret fund for his family to fall
back on, nor any family to ask for food.  His parents scraped by,
refusing to turn to the murderous and thieving customs.  They were
attempting to set an example for Mikael's brother and himself.  For
the remainder of their childhood, this worked.  They learned to keep
their noses clean, and managed day to day with what they had. 
Eventually luck came their way, Mikael's father picked up a small
guards job for the town bank.  It paid little, for money was short in
Sanaria, so what good was a bank?  Life became easier, until the day
everything began to crumble...  A desperate bum attempted to rob the
Sanaria bank.  Mikael's father was no real warrior, no formal
fighting training, so when the bum's knife slid into his father's
side, it was all over.  Of course Mikael's mother told the boys not
to blame themselves, but Mikael's younger brother became bitter to
the world anyways, plotting, planning, always wanting to take
revenge, or reap pain upon other just to mask his own.  Mikael on the
other hand, strayed only slightly.  For a month after his father's
death, Mikael's steady character that he held himself too caught the
eye of a knight, no ordinary knight though, a rare breed these
days...  A Paladin.  The paladin offered Mikael a new life, a life
with money he could send home to his family..  And so he took it. 
Yet his brother's bitterness grew.
