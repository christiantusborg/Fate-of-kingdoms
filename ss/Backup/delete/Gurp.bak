Desc Gurp stands before you.  He towers at a massive 22 feet tall,
weighing well over 1500 stones.  His skin is a deep blue, but has no
hair, nothing but a shinny bald head.  Strangely, he has two heads. 
One marked with confusion and stupidity, the other masked with a
hood, bright glowing eyes shinning from the shadows.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  Gurp was born in a
village in the middle of nowhere.  His mother was a Giant whore (not
as in huge, just the race giant) and his father was a Giant pimp
(once again, race).  His father proceeded to use her as he wished,
thus, the bastard child Gurp was born.  His name derives from the
first noise he made after birth, a gurping noise.  He was a stun to
his society.  Being born with two heads, rare for any race, most
would have thought him to be a disgrace, but rather he was looked at
as an idol.  He was then placed upon an alter, it is said..  Really
it was a stump from a tree torn apart.  There he was worshipped for
being an oddity and much food was brought to him.  For the first
couple years of his life he sat on this log, eating, growing in
girth.  And muscle.  At age 1 1/2 one of his heads gave a mighty roar
and began to speak in an ancient tongue.  It so happens this head
seemed to be blessed with intelligence..  While the other..  Well.. 
Rather retarded in all standards of intelligence.
