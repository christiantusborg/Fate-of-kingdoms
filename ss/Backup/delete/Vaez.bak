{D A nightmare, literally, stands in front of you. This is what
one would refer to as 'the monster in the closet'. A wretched
{Dand brutish troll, almost 10 feet tall. His skin is some kind
{Dof dark {mpurple{D shade, glowing intensely,  almost as if it was
{Drenewing itself. His long, and surprisingly beautiful hair is
suitably as black the night.. ..or as your darkest nightmares.

Back After what seemed like an eternity, Vaezeron woke up
from a horrible dream.  He dreamt he had been killed
which to Vaezeron was a paradox. He was a god,  thus
couldn't be killed.
However, not very long after his awakening, Vaezeron
noticed something was different.  His hair was pitch
black and it reached to his feet. He also noticed he
was huge.  His hands were enormous, and his skin had
a weird shimmering glow. He remembered he had a long
name, Vaez-something. He shrugged at the thought and
decided to call himself just Vaez.
