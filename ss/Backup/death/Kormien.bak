Immtitle Immortal~
Back The Demon Zelphax roared.
 
  Kormien sa'Gorn, Angel's Bane, Keeper of Darkness, hovered in the
dim grey expanse of the Void.  The shadowy form of Zelphax loomed
over him, eyes of fire blazing with spite.
 
 
  "We are linked inexorably, you and I," the Greater Demon spat.
"You can never escape me.  What I give you now, this gift, it does
not come freely."
 
  Kormien stared into the burning eyes.  "I'm no idiot, Zelphax.  I
know that you never 'give' anything to anyone."  Floating closer to
what seemed to be a multifaceted glass window, Kormien could see the
blue marble that was Thera floating in the endless expanse of space.
This was his ticket out of the Afterlife.  "I wonder, though.  You
have railed about power since I came into your service so many years
ago.  But...where was your power when Narssius broke?  Where was it
when indomitable Torsanctus was overthrown?  We, your servants, called
out to you.  You abandoned us.  How will this time be...different?"
 
  Zelphax's form appeared obstinate.  "You try me, mortal.  Know only
that I am giving you this chance at life.  You can take this offer and
live again, or you can remain here as so much protomatter.  I will
not suffer your acid tongue."  Zelphax smiled smugly.  "So then.  Will
you take my power with you and go back into Thera?"
 
  Kormien looked at the world, and back to the Demon.  He nodded.
"I accept your proposal, Zelphax.  As it was long ago...so shall it
be once again.  I can only pray that you will hold your end of the
bargain this time."
 
  With that, the Demon Zelphax laughed.  Kormien felt the fabric of
his existence expand as the demoniac forces entered his soul.
 
  The world went black.
 
  A blinding flash of light filled Kormien's steel grey eyes.  It
took him several minutes to realize that he was seeing the sun - the
true Theran sun - for the first time in ages.  Muddy grass crumpled in
his fists as he pushed himself to his feet.  Solid ground supported him.
This truly was Thera.  This was home.
 
  How were things different?  This remains to be seen.  One thing is
for certain, however.  The emerging with Zelphax's force left Kormien
marked.  He would soon see that his skin had an otherworldly pale tinge
to it, and his ears were slightly pointed.
 
  Kormien sa'Gorn, once a simple human being from a backwater Sanarian
province, had become something different.  He had become something Else.
