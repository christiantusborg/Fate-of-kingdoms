Desc Standing before you is a tall thin being.  It looks almost human
like untill you get to its head.  Its head is large and egg shaped
with two large oval shaped eyes.  The eyes are a milky white color,
and the fluid inside the eyes seems to swirl around.  Long tentacles
hang down from the head where the mouth should be.  Small barbs can
be seem at the ends of the tentacles.  It seems to cover most of its
body with a long black cloak of some kind.  Only the tips of its long
narrow fingers can be seen dangling from somewhere in the cloak.  It
appears to have no weapons.  And it has an odd smell that seems to
suround it.

Back Naardov grew up in many differnt planes.  Not unlike most
Illithids.  His clan moving from plane to plane tring to overpower as
many races as it could.  You see the illithid race is not one that
wishs to do any work them selves.  They are more the ones to over
power a weaker mental race to doign all the work for them.  So this
is how Naardov speant most of his childhood.  The Darnok was a race
that seemed the most interesting to Naardov.  It was a race that was
quite powerfull and his clan head a slim hold on the race.  The it
happend The Darnoks broke free of the control that had held them for
so many ages.  The battle was fearce, and bloody.  Many died that
day, and the illithids was forced to retreat do to the great
unbalance of numbers against them.  Naardov and a few of his clan
retreated to the Underdark, forced to do jobs for the wretched Drows.
Not as slaves or anything like that but more as mercenarys.  Naardov
grew sick of this rather quickly, but learned much from the wicked
Drow.  He decided to venture to the sufface and see what he could do
with the surface creatures himself.  After spending some time in the
forests and just watching the surface dwellers and reading some of
thier thoughts as they passed by him unknowingly.  Naardov thought to
himself most of these races will easy to overcome.  They are so weak
in the mind they should easily be held by a few of our race.  He
started by gathering a few serfs here and there to get him supplies
and dig him out a suitable dwelling in the side of a mountian. 
During this time he thought more and more about not telling the
others of this place.  That way he could rule it all and have to
answer to none.  He then used his mind control to venture more into
the cities to further his knowlage of the this plane.  He noticed
that many differnt races made this plane thier home ans some would be
much easier to control than others would.  The larger races seemed to
be the biggest fools and thier strength would prove to be very
usefull if Naardov was to make himself ruler of these realms.
