Desc Before you stand a male darnok by the name of Skaiku.  He is of
average height and has dark hair.  He is wearing an old dark cloak
concealing his weapons.  On his face are some minor scars which
appear to be quite old.  He does however not appear to be very
strong, but he looks quite agile.

Back This is the story of Skaiku the thief.  Little is known about his
past, but there are some things that has been told which may or may
not be true.  Some say that he is decendant of a thief from the
ancient kingdom of Torsanctus with the same name.  He was raised by
thieves and thus was he trained to be dishonest and liking the
5-finger discount.  When he was young he was once caught trying to
steal a bread from a local store.  The storeowner was a nice man and
as such he told to Skaiku that if he promised never to steal again he
could leave with involving the sheriff.  He made that promise to the
shopowned, but he would not keep that promise for long.  However he
left his current home and went travelling to find great treasures to
steal.  After quite a bit of travelling he came to a town named
Sanaria.  There he saw noticed a key laying on the ground and so he
picked it up, but he did not know what the key was for.  The key
looked like it was quite old as it had quite a bit of rust on it.  He
did not have any rush with finding out where the key would fit and so
he put it in his pocket for safekeeping.  He thought that Sanaria was
quite boring and so he headed far east and after some time he came to
a town named New Thalos.  He saw many travellers there and they
seemed to have big pockets with many valuable items in them.  He
would then make it his quest to obtain these riches and so he made
New Thalos his home.
