Desc Before you stands a rather strange looking creature.  Humanoid in
structure, no one would mistake this individual for a man.  His skin
tone is dark grey, with black splotches littering his complection,
and there's a cloth over where you would think his mouth would be. 
This thing is completely hairless- his head is bald and shiny, and it
even looks a little wet, as if there's water seeping discreetly from
his skin.  His large eyes are dark and hatelful looking, with little
purple dots seemingly splattered across their entirety.  This
creature is not very large- standing approximately 5 feet in the air.
It's hard to tell how much he may weigh under the elaborate robes
he's wearing, but it can't be much.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  To talk of Henn's past
is like talking about that history of anything without people there
to witness it.  The only thing that can be said for sure is that Henn
was not born on Thera.  Henn himself has suffered advanced amnesia-
what he believes is a direct result from his arrival to Thera.  There
are multiple scars he sports as souvenirs of his arrival, but Henn
cannot remember how exactly any of these came to be.  Henn's memory
begins when he woke in Arkham, not so many years ago.  He was bloody,
sore.  His whole body suffered and ached.  Naked, he lie in an
abanodoned alley completely vulnerable to anyone who may want to
finish him off.  As days progressed he managed to tap into the minds
off passerbys- gaining a brief understanding of their language, of
their ways, what they did to survive....  Only he could not execute
with his emaciated, broken body...  Until one day a great commotion
happened in the city of Arkham.  There was a batlle of sorts as Henn
could understand from the minds of the belligerants, and finally he
could feel the relief in the thoughts of the offenders.  They had
achieved victory.  Soon after the battle, Henn blacked out for days. 
He eventually woke to a bright room, with nurses tending to himself
and the many other patients that surrounded him.  He felt better.  He
felt slightly nourished- though he couldn't imagine what they may
have been nourishing him with.  He felt capable.  He could move.  The
days ran into himself in the brief period he was at this place of
rehabilitation.  He could not tell one day from the next- but he
could tell from their thoughts that none of them were sure of exactly
what he was.  They were afraid of him- not because they thought he
posed a threat, but because they were so ignorant of what it was
exactly that they were tending to.  And one day, Henn showed them
exactly what they were caring for.  Henn was not aware of what he
was- only that he was very different from anything here.  On one
fateful day, before the sun set, and as the nurses readied the
patients for a peaceful night, Henn gathered all of the mental
strength he could muster.  He had been waiting for weeks to do this-
he could scarcely stand these people and their weak thoughts, their
weak minds.  As they stood, or as they slept he killed them all.  It
happened in an instant, and they were all convulsing, eyes rolling to
the top of their heads, foaming from their mouthes, not a thought in
their head any longer.  Henn began his journey on Thera from this
point, with no remorse to those who had cared for him.
