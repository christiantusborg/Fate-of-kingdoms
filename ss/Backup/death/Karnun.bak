Desc This duergar is of the average height of his kin with large
shoulders and a stout physique.  He is very muscular.  He has
dark-colored skin, and a grumpy elderly face.  He wears a weapon with
familiarity, his hand resting by the hilt, ready to be drawn at first
sign of violence.  He has a thick brown mustache and a long beard
matching in color.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Karnun was born in the infamous Underdark into a violent home.  He
was the second son of Kearnam Darkstone and Eirkana Destoman.  Being
the second born gave him a status of inferiority and thus he had an
abusive childhood whereas his brother Kanund was given the all. 
During his extensive time, when he was ignored and uncared for,
Karnun sharpened his skills in the dark arts as well as practiced his
melee combat skills.  One night, when he got home, his noted his
aggressive family was rather in a ill mood, a mood he realized abit
too late.  They had unleashed their rage upon him, taking turns into
beating him until it pained him to even move.  That night, on his
bed, he swore vengence and unholy retribution upon the injustice and
mistreatement he had suffered at the hands of his own flesh and
blood.  Several years later, as Karnun matured into an adult and
refined his skills at both dark magic and swordsmanship, he decided
to act and reclaim justice.  That night, he awaited the return of his
kin.  When they arrived, he was prepared resting on table, a blade on
his knees.  When his father entered, followed by his mother and
brother, their eyes were drawn on the blade and a look of shock and
terror pierced their face.  "Do not worry, I will let you defend
yourselves, I am not without honor, father.  Mother.  Brother." 
Karnun said, as mischieveous smile upon his face as he tossed a pair
of swords at the feet of his family.  His brother picked up the sword
and attacked him without warning only to be blocked easily by Karnun
sword.  His father followed in suit and Karnun deflected the blow
instinctly.  Blows were exchanged between the trio, Father and Eldest
Son, against the Second Son.  The mother stood in the back muttering
curses at the Second Son, while cheering the other two.  Yet Karnun
was far too skilled for the other two, and as the other two's muscles
tired, Karnun was still lacking sweat and shortly after overpowered
them both and pierced them both.  He left them bleeding and turned
just in time to deflect his mother's dagger.
