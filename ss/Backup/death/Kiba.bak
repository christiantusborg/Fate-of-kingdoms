Desc You stand before this giant. As he towers over you, as you look up at this 
man you see that his body is covered in many scar, he seem to be missing 
most of his left ear his face has a vacant look too it almost as if he was 
always thinking of some thing way off in the distance, he also wear a 
necklace made of many fangs of wild animals.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Kiba was born the son of a village chieftain.  Of a warrior tribe
he grew up knowing he was going to be the leader of his village one
day.  He was trained to be a great warrior from the time he was old
enough to hold a weapon.  When he was 13 years old his village was
destroyed by a nation trying to expand their territory.  After having
his village destroyed he went to live with his uncle.  He finished
his training and joined the military of a nation in direct conflict
with the nation that destroyed his village.  He made his way through
the ranks to make general and to be in command of an army of 50,000. 
After the war he met a beautiful human woman and fell in love with
her even though the nation disliked inner species relationships. 
Including her brother how was a 4 star general in the military.  He
went to have a kid with her life was good until one day he came home
to find his wife dead and his brother and law pointing his finger at
him.  Before he could be arrested he sent his son away.  He would be
convicted of his wifes murder even though he new he did not do it. 
He went on to spend 8 years in a jail until he finally escaped.  He
lives his life now to do two things find his son and clear his name. 
Through his research of the crime it is his belief that it was her
brother who killed his wife.  He does not know what to do with his
life now, but he does know one thing he will find his son and he will
avenge his wifes death or die trying.  He has been wondering from
place to place searching for clues that could lead him to his wifes
killer.  Along the way he takes every opportunity to make him self
stronger.
