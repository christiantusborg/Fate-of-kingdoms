Greetings Ghuo,
 
I have talked with Angel and Levithian, they say that due
to the global financial crisis and some wrong stock market dealings.
 
THey do not have enough funds for equipment, because they do need
their clothes, they both have to space out the drops to adventures.
 
On behalf of Angel and Levithian.
 
Kind regards,
 
Explorerdk,
God of Time and Wisdom
 
Ps. We have not at this time, decided, if they are going to recieve a
Aid package.

Hey...  I just finished up with school so I've got a fair amount

you'll have me.  If you are still looking for builders let me know
and I'll be happy to help out.

Go along the road west of San.
Maybe 10 east of Elvander and north of the road go north into the forest.
It should be pretty close to the road (maybe 3 north or so), but you won't be able to see it until you get within 1 or 2 rooms away.
You'll know you found it because it will be a room allowing you to go in all directions (except up).
In order to enter you have to go down.
This is definetly not the best set of directions but hopefully it will give you an idea of where to look.

Yo.  I posted a review for Fate on the mudconnect site.
I think first reviews need admin approval before they
go through, so you might want to check your account
there or your email about it.  Hopefully drum up some

I was trying to vanish into the room so I did not have to bug
you.  It was no a rush job I have other chars I play too so 
it was no big deal to have to wait.  Not to mention I have been
working tons of hours so I have limited time to play.  I just 
wanted to see if I could tear him up is all heheh.  On the other
hand though I noticed when I am useing a spell caster that when I 
am thrown it fucks up my consentration and it is awhile before I 
can cast that does nto seem to work on mobs.  Anyway we can work 
on that or do you want me to post it on bugs?

Hey.  Just wanted to drop you a line, for when your
fingers get to workin' again...:P
 
 
The reason I'm no longer around here anymore is that
I've taken a Head Builder/Admin of Areas position on
an entirely different MUD, it's called The Third
Turning, and we're based on the Wheel of Time universe
and Robert Jordan's books.  Even if you haven't read
the books, though, it's cool...our timeline is set
so far in the past of the main story that you don't
really have to know anything about it.  The head coder
is absolutely AMAZING, very dedicated, intelligent and
hard-working.  Gameplay involves infinite extended
levels, with open-ended character building.  I predict
it's gonna be big :P.  The MUD is currently in Beta
Test phase, but we're open for players.  I just thought
I'd let you know about it, and you're more than welcome
to drop by sometime if ya want.  You, Kyle and Nelphad
are the only FoK people I've let in on this.
 
 
 
Anyway, catch ya later!
