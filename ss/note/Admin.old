I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.

had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient

Advertising is gonna be the single best thing we could probably do.
Our pbase has always been the issue and an updated website with
a myspace account would definetly be helpful. I honestly do'nt 
know when the last time I was on mudconnect but as I recall
even when I did check it we where never high on the rankings. 
 
If there is anything i can do i suppose let me know, and umm HI 
by the way hopefully i'll getta see you bums around.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an

Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an

twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Our pbase has always been the issue and an updated website with

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.

Our pbase has always been the issue and an updated website with
a myspace account would definetly be helpful. I honestly do'nt 
know when the last time I was on mudconnect but as I recall
even when I did check it we where never high on the rankings. 
 
If there is anything i can do i suppose let me know, and umm HI 
by the way hopefully i'll getta see you bums around.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.

Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Our pbase has always been the issue and an updated website with
a myspace account would definetly be helpful. I honestly do'nt 
know when the last time I was on mudconnect but as I recall
even when I did check it we where never high on the rankings. 
 
If there is anything i can do i suppose let me know, and umm HI

   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Here's an idea for a board on the forum -- it's not exactly
an RP-specific board, but more like a place to post old
stories, memories, logs, etc. etc.  Call it "Tales" or

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

would be the master assassin in his background.  When I 
critiqued it he just quit.  After his fit he through later
I have decided that his rp is illegal and anything he does
by it should be treated as such.
 
If you have a problem with this, come talk to me.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

At first when izuzu first presented his rp, I didn't have
a problem with.  The problem came when he decided that he
would be the master assassin in his background.  When I 
critiqued it he just quit.  After his fit he through later
I have decided that his rp is illegal and anything he does
by it should be treated as such.
 
If you have a problem with this, come talk to me.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Here's an idea for a board on the forum -- it's not exactly

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

would be the master assassin in his background.  When I 
critiqued it he just quit.  After his fit he through later
I have decided that his rp is illegal and anything he does
by it should be treated as such.
 
If you have a problem with this, come talk to me.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject izuzu's rp~
Text
At first when izuzu first presented his rp, I didn't have
a problem with.  The problem came when he decided that he
would be the master assassin in his background.  When I 
critiqued it he just quit.  After his fit he through later
I have decided that his rp is illegal and anything he does
by it should be treated as such.
 
If you have a problem with this, come talk to me.

Subject ideas~

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Text
At first when izuzu first presented his rp, I didn't have
a problem with.  The problem came when he decided that he
would be the master assassin in his background.  When I 
critiqued it he just quit.  After his fit he through later
I have decided that his rp is illegal and anything he does
by it should be treated as such.
 
If you have a problem with this, come talk to me.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Right now I personally dont see any use for builders
except for them to go through and fix the gear and the mobs
there after.  If we are going to implementing a new
world map and such as Bael suggested then we dont currentlyt
need any new areas.  That is my opinion which is open to

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Right now I personally dont see any use for builders
except for them to go through and fix the gear and the mobs
there after.  If we are going to implementing a new
world map and such as Bael suggested then we dont currentlyt
need any new areas.  That is my opinion which is open to
suggestion.  Let me know.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I didn't realize that agony was that high level of a spell
I still think it sounds like a mal spell.  How about you 
give it to a mal at 79 untill you get mal high level spells

Subject ideas~

I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

get a Crestore?  It really sucks when you killed by a mob that is
not even in the room with you.  Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Why is it that ultrablast is the only area attack spell that

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Think we can please get ranged casting fixed?  And maybe I can

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject Tritnium Eq and assassins shrine~
Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject Tritnium Eq and assassins shrine~
Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject Tritnium Eq and assassins shrine~
Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Why is it that ultrablast is the only area attack spell that

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Think we can please get ranged casting fixed?  And maybe I can

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some

become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

Text
I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

Subject ghost of the queen~
Text
I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Why is it that ultrablast is the only area attack spell that

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

Subject ghost of the queen~
Text
I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

I really think we should rethink the spell system.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject ghost of the queen~
Text
I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject ghost of the queen~
Text
I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject ghost of the queen~

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject ghost of the queen~
Text
I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Subject Tritnium Eq and assassins shrine~
Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

Text
I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the

I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not

I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine

I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

I really think we should rethink the spell system.

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis

6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
