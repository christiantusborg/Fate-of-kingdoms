Why is it that ultrablast is the only area attack spell that

I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
I really think we should rethink the spell system.
 
Currently we have spells that you learn very early which become some
of the most powerful spells in the game. And high level spells which
become just useless. If no recoding is done on them, it wouldn't be
difficult to see which spells these are, and move them according to
their power (weak spells to a lower level, etc.)
 
If we can get things into working order, we could, perhaps, begin to
branch out and make the "cool" things to keep people playing (and attract
new players, perhaps).

I recently went through and killed all the people in the assassins shrine
and tried to make the gear tritnium, only the rings could be made tritnium
and then the class flags on the rings are for warriors and mercenaries, not
assassin. So if you guys might be able to fix the shrine and maybe the
tritnium rings so assassins can wear em, that would be cool. Thanks

I was wondering if I can get malyki and villik crestored.
I was fighting the ghost of the queen with malyki and she
started doing that gay ass when I get low on hp I will gate
and turn invis to stop combat thing. (while fairie fired) 
odd I can not turn invis when I fairie fired.  So I have to 
flee and she killes me from the other room with a multi 
misile.  I take it and go back a get my stuff heal up and
go back to finish her off.  she conitues the gay ass gate
thing and I end up getting killed again in the room this time.
I log on villik and Rizz is trying to help me get malykis
corpse out.  Can't drag it out and she kills Villik.  I wasted
6 hours of my life ot get that damn orb and all I got was two 
nekked chars because of some poor coding.  I am pissed!  That 
stupid ass gate thing needs to be removed and who ever came up 
with drug out into the street and shot.
