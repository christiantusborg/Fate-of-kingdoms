Ok ray of truth is getting a little out of control
Takes two shots before a mob my level blinds me
every time I go in there.  I have -160 saves.
Takes san healer 63 times to cure it and she is hooded
to me.  Needs tweaked a bit I think.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or

I ate a fido's guts and got poisoned from it.  While suffering

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

I ate a fido's guts and got poisoned from it.  While suffering
from the poison it began to miss me.  Not sure if that was an
intended effect or not.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

Ok ray of truth is getting a little out of control
Takes two shots before a mob my level blinds me
every time I go in there.  I have -160 saves.
Takes san healer 63 times to cure it and she is hooded

x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

Ok ray of truth is getting a little out of control
Takes two shots before a mob my level blinds me

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

Ok ray of truth is getting a little out of control
Takes two shots before a mob my level blinds me
every time I go in there.  I have -160 saves.
Takes san healer 63 times to cure it and she is hooded
to me.  Needs tweaked a bit I think.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Ok ray of truth is getting a little out of control
Takes two shots before a mob my level blinds me
every time I go in there.  I have -160 saves.
Takes san healer 63 times to cure it and she is hooded
to me.  Needs tweaked a bit I think.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.

from the poison it began to miss me.  Not sure if that was an

I'd like to request that all bugs be detailed as possible. Up to and including messages you receive when doing
x, a skill you're using, if the skill has been disabled for x reason, you're seeing x happen when you do y, and
so forth. This will help me implement new changes, as well as fixing old ones. It's tedious sometimes, but it
will be required if new changes/fixes are requested.
 
Thanks.

Is there anyway possable to take teleport out of mage acts?
As if mage act mobs are not powerfull enough they already.
Not to mention us chars with charm and no transport spells
have a hard time finding our charmies if something teleports
them away.  Last thing a newbie wants to run into is a cryo or
some dread and shadow wolves.  Thanks.
