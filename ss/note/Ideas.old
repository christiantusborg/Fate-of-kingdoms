Subject New Race~
Text
As per my discussion with Kazmir, here's an idea for a new race.  I
think this would be a good replacement for Arials, since nobody plays
them to begin with.  Also, it'd give "Good" a heavy-hitter.
 
 
Race Name:  Celestines
Size:  Large
Prime Stat:  STR or WIS
STR: 21 DEX: 19 CON: 19 INT: 20 WIS: 22
Vuln:  negative/darkness
Resist:  light
Align:  Good/Neutral
Racial:  Celestial Light (blind or damage or both, possibly level-based?)
 
DESC:  Celestines are similar to angels.  They're large, humanoid beings that
come from the Postive Energy Plane.  They're bright, beautiful and sometimes
terrible creatures who fly on wings of crackling energy.  They are rumored to
be from the primordial days of Thera's birth, and stand anywhere from 7-8 feet
tall.  Their divine heritage allows them to summon forth a bolt of bright
energy, blinding their foes.
 
 
Just a rough idea.

As per my discussion with Kazmir, here's an idea for a new race.  I

As per my discussion with Kazmir, here's an idea for a new race.  I
think this would be a good replacement for Arials, since nobody plays
them to begin with.  Also, it'd give "Good" a heavy-hitter.

Racial:  Celestial Light (blind or damage or both, possibly level-based?)

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

It was my understanding that your race was changed after a series

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need

MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

It was my understanding that your race was changed after a series

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also

My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types

so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So

Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types

so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY

I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in

Subject Eating/Drinking~

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn

The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his

Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since

The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world

I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So

Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

I think that adding detect invis (again) at the least.  What kind of
assassin can't find a target?  And maybe add invis again, cause we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play

tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your

we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his

Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since

The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world

I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck

Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since

The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since

I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more

remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a

Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke

This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the

so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think

on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

I looked clerics over the other day and they seem to very

notices some spells I think evil cleric will not be able

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?

limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the

as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to

extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be

If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark
spell and vise-versa...i still like the idea of there still being
alignment..just it being based on what you do in the game...kinda
like the rp game Fable.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Text
Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Subject Skill mid = high....~
Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

short on the offence.  As well they should be, but I also
notices some spells I think evil cleric will not be able 
to cast like holy aura, golden aura ans such.  Any way evil
cleics could have unholy aura, and dark aura and such? 
Just a thought.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"
you are.

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark
spell and vise-versa...i still like the idea of there still being
alignment..just it being based on what you do in the game...kinda
like the rp game Fable.

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Subject Second thoughts about races~
Text
Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark
spell and vise-versa...i still like the idea of there still being
alignment..just it being based on what you do in the game...kinda
like the rp game Fable.

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Text
Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.

that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Subject Skill mid = high....~
Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get

because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain

(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Subject Second thoughts about races~
Text
Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Subject Skill mid = high....~
Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"
you are.

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark
spell and vise-versa...i still like the idea of there still being

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get
rid of spells like holy aura. or holy (anything) or dark (anything)
because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark
spell and vise-versa...i still like the idea of there still being
alignment..just it being based on what you do in the game...kinda
like the rp game Fable.

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or

so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

Subject FoK your website~
Text
I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and

be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,  
revamps somehwere I just have to find it.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Text
Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Subject Idea~
Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which

on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Subject Drunk junk~
Text
Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.

that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Subject Skill mid = high....~
Text
Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alignment restrictions will likely be lifted.
 
Alignment itself makes no sense, so I would really like
it to be relegated to RP oriented only. If this happens,
then all the spells will work no matter what "alignment"

if we are going to lift align all together then we need to get

because someone rping good should not beable to use a dark

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races

Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we

we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Subject skills/spells/various suggestions~
Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it

remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of

just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Text
Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Subject Eating/Drinking~
Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain

(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)
 
Love always.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their

Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I

it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.
i always enjoyed your equipment :)

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

We could do this using the Mage, Spellfilcher, Alchemist, and perhaps one new class.
 
Not saying we WILL do this, but we could. Especially since Spellfilcher and Alchemist
aren't widely used.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Vampires are a seperate race?  I've always maintained (and
I THOUGHT this was Dermos/Kazmir's intention) that vampires
be a template that could be quested for or whatnot.  So
you'd say I'm an elf, I'm an alchemist...WHO IS ALSO A VAMPIRE!
 
 
Of course, I'm going off memory that's at LEAST 6 years old.
Vampires would work just fine as a seperate race.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?
 
 
Thank you,

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time

you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Just and idea but I think there should be differnt types
of mages.  transmuter, elementelist, conjurer, illusionist,
and so on and so forth.  Make them all unique, and by doing
so it might balance the mage class out and depower the CRAZY
UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know
I have a whole book of ideas for skills, spells, class's,

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Text
I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Subject Second thoughts about races~
Text
Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Subject Cleric idea~
Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

UBER MAGE class.  and with races I think if you are goign to 
a very strong race Ie  vampire they should be very strong, also
extreamly hard to play and level.  Just some thoughts.  I know

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Text
Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Something else I thought of today that could be changed:

to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Since im new again to the mud i only got to see a little bit
of whats been getting changed around. But i really do wanna make
more submissions about what i think would be good assets for what
seems to be unfinished class's. 
 
Ill just start with the char i made today first.
 
If you ever get to peek at the monk skill set or had the chance to 
play around with critical strike, you know it doest fall short of 
alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

I'd like to propose the idea of removing eating and drinking. Not only are the messages well.. quite annoying,
and occur quite often, but it's pretty tedious to the player (mainly newbies) to constantly eat/drink every 30
minutes or so.
 
Here's my proposal:
1. Remove eating/drinking penalties and/or requirements. (As well as the repetitive messages) 
2. Implement an additional bonus for players that decide to eat/drink, as a bonus for role playing.
 
Yes, eating/drinking is essential, in a real life situation. However so is other.. well.. unmentionables I need
not mention. However I think the lower level players would enjoy gaining levels as well as other aspects of the
MUD, rather than chasing down food/drink every 30 minutes.
 
Keep in mind this is just a proposal, I'd like responses, not hate mail. Please consider wisely.
 
Thanks.

I like the idea of getting rid of ESSENTIAL eating/drinking.
 
Could it be made that the hunger/thirst messages be toggled
off?  Make it to where keeping your character full gives you
a bonus to regeneration.

Text
Lets face it.  As of right now all we have is some of
the old hard core players (like myself).  For me it is
just getting a little boring.  I have gotten all most 
every item there is to get at one time or another, and 
played almost every class at one time or another.  There
is no kingdoms no wars no pk.  Things are getting boring.
My idea is this.  Start working on a whole new set of class's.
I know it takes a ton of work to create skills and spells and
code them all in.  But if you got 3 or 4 new ones in, I think 
the p-bace might pick up.  If the bace picks up then maybe we 
can get some kingdoms and wars and all the good stuff back. 
Seems like we always had the highest p-bace on at one time
when wars were in affect ;).  Just an idea.

Good idea on the new races.  I think I know the ones to which
you're referring -- the races that Kazmir was going to implement
on the fabled and legendary Fate 4.  I think there were like, um
rat people, air elementals, minotaur, GNOMES, halflings...vampire
and werewolf races, too.  I say implement 'em ALL, and let God
sort it out.
 
Especially Gnomes.

Come to think of it, I think the primary push should be
on the classes.  Fate's got a pretty damn good mix of races
already, and they're all decent, what with their stats and
racial abilities (except those that suck, i.e. arial).
Other than a few duds, they're a pretty strong mixture.
 
Of course, if you ever feel the overpowering need to make
gnomes playable...by all means.

Text
One more idea before I go to bed.  I like the idea of clerics
being hard to kill, and hard to kill with.  Goes with their
archetypical role of being (mostly) guides, herders, and
support for mortals.  I like the image of the cleric as being
someone who, when spelled up, will let you blow your load in
trying to kill him, and then give you a patronizing look when
you're done and ask you "do you feel better now that's out of
your system?".  
 
 
Anyway.
 
 
One aspect of clerics that gets screwed are Netural-aligned
clerics.  They don't have access to good and evil's big
spells, nor do they have something that makes them unique and
interesting.  This is something I'll be thinking about more
later, but for now I have an idea.  Why not take flamestrike,
remove it from the low-level spell list, and re-tool it as a
big, badass, high-level BOOM?  Something for neutral clerics
to use with impunity, free from the moral implications of,
say, death field or holy word.

Yep sounds like a good idea, that would just involve switching skills around and revamping their
damage and shit for now.  Also some of the new classes I found in the code are called conjurer, witch, etc.
Which could also be a fix to that problem if need be.
 
 
A race for vampire is also already coded, but no racial for it. I have been looking at the racial codes that
I can find, they are all mixed in with skill codes and crap so they are hard to spot, but they seem to be 
pretty straight forward, so either maybe a new race like vampire could hasve a racial making them strong, OR
just boost their stats from creation, like hp gain and such.

Yeah you like that note title Exa ;)
okay well first off our biggest problem is lack of players, we
desperatly need to get more, and then once we have a player base
we need to push RPing, like mandatory backgrounds/desc.  So if
anyone knows how to contact old players try and get them to play
again.  Also need to get the website back up, get good on popular
MUD lists, reestablish FoK as the top MUD out there.  Got a super
geeky friend?  Get them to play!  Got a significant other invite them
tell them they don't really love you unless they play too, PPL in your
school don't want to play?  Go in there with a gun and make them
we will lose you as a player, but who knows how many we will gain
(okay that last one is a bad idea dont do that plz)
(but then again prisons have internet now)
we need to get kingdoms, otherwise it's Fate of a bunch of loser guys
But its useless to do that until we have players.
now when it comes to the actual game.  We need to get rid of the damn
mandatory quests (oh yeah we dont need to make the backgrounds
and desc mandatory, maybe just after a certain lvl like before or
make it so they can't join the kingdoms like in the past)
quests should be for the fun of it to get RP points and exp gold or
awesome eq.  
so players, RPing, and no more FoKing mandatory quests.

I definitely agree on that website issue.  The WWW site is
probably one of the first things folks will judge a MUD by.
I know if I'm just browsing mudconnect and a game doesn't
have a website, they're immediately suspect and bushleague
in my opinion.  Obviously, that's not always right, however
prejudice is fun.  ANYWAY.  About that site...
 
 
1.  Who can we mine from our pre-existing pool of people
to work on it?  Does anyone know website making or know
anyone that does?  More importantly, will they do it
for frees?
 
2.  Who can volunteer to provide content?  I like to write
bullshit, so I can help on that front.  Illustrations of
all the races would also be tits, however my art skill is
limited to strictly the pencil and paper variety and that
does us no good.  Anyone know anybody who can draw on the
computer machine?
 
 
3.  What kind of content?  Obviously we need race and class
info.  Probably just the helpfiles transferred over, or
a reasonable facsimile thereof.  Those drawings would be
nice too, as well as an artistic rendition of the world
map.  Why?  Why not.  A basic history/story would be nice,
as well.  I remember one day that I was going to pool everyone's
FoKing knowledge and write one massive history of Fate.  I'll
probably never do that, but something less ambitious would
fit nicely.  Also, a newbie guide is a great idea (stuff like
how to level, where to go, good newbie race/class combos, etc.).
Any other sort of user-generated content would be nice...say,
I'm getting an idea as I'm writing this, so bear with me.
Actually, I think I'll save it for another note.  I'm just
free-typing right now, and I wish I could stop.
 
 
4.  What language should it be in?  English, for God's sake.
 
 
5.  If we cannot find someone to help with the site, what
channels do we need to pursue to do so?

Good ideas.
 
The website issue is one that has been thrown around quite a bit.
I know how to make a BASIC website, but nothing fancy, and I suck
at art. Marius is awesome at art, but busy. Maybe I can hold his
girlfriend hostage until he draws some pictures or something.
 
Race and class write-ups will need to be done. Especially since
some of their bases have been changed.
 
The newbie guide would be slightly pre-mature at this point, since
we will likely be changing the face of Thera pretty soon (new world
map, hopefully), and with it should be slightly more obvious where
to go.
 
I also agree with the removal of the mandatory quests. Especially
since they are so vague and difficult to complete without gate/portal
and experience doing them.

Ok, so as for the website art, I can do 1 of two things.
 
 
The slow process: Hash out detailed drawings of each race, which will take atleast a week
per race if I work on it everyday in my spare time. Then once i get into my last Animation
class next semester, which is human modeling, I can start rendering 3-D versions (much like
seen on www.diablo3.com) and we can have neato animated 3-D characters on the site (which
could help or hurt the mud, being that it could make people think "wow... looks cool 3-d... hate txt).
 
 
 
The fast process: I sketch out real fast crappy outlines of each race for now.
 
 
To add to the fast, the fast crappy would turn into detailed sketches to replace them over time, then
once again, that would turn in to 3-D renderings of the races in the end.
 
 
 
I would definetly like to do the 3-D renderings, seeing as how i want to work on video games once
I graduate next december. This would allow that content to be of my use without having to
ask permission from Kazmir and what not... being that im not being paid... and its art...
which evidently counts as a form of speech so F u if you think I should ask lol.... god
I love the bending on the first amendment. 
 
 
Which would you prefer?

If you're willing to make 3-D renderings of races, I
say go for it.  There's no need to feel a huge rush, since
we've basically got NOTHING right now.  In the long run,
it will be more beneficial.
 
 
Something else I thought of today that could be changed:
hometowns.  Basically the only two worth picking are
Sanaria and New Thalos, and they're pretty much the
hubs of activitiy for the mud.  Pity the poor newb that
picks Gondor or (god forbid) Ofcol and is put in the
middle of (relative) nowhere.  It might be a good idea
to winnow down the list of hometowns to San and NT.
 
Oh, I forgot Arkham is on the list (isn't it?  I genuinely
can't reacall atm) but maybe it should be kept too.  Evil
needs a home too, y'know.  :D

Alright,  
 I am from long ago and i remember what got me addicted to this place.
one was the available of the eq to all.  I remember people bringing me eq that now
only people of level 81 could wear when i was level 17.  I also remember the skills on the
base of the code were much more powerful and useful.  Also the levels were not changed to higher.
My suggestion since this mud is really not pk bound anymore maybe we should focus on skills and spells
at lower levels that will be more affective to level.  I.e. attack levels at lower levels. maybe attack spells
at higher level like flamestrike for myself.  I would take fourth attack before i would take flamestrike.
i would take sanctuary before i would take dual wield.  Just because it would help  me level. 
to me maybe the level restrictions are just what started killing the mud. I.e. because certain people died alot
and could not handle it then got into power.  yes still bitter about that but hey thats how it worked.  And when
that still did not help they started to take the fun out of it.  Restrict restrict restrict.  Every time you do that
you kill fun.  Yes it is harder for some people easier for others but thats why you network and make friends on
here to help you. keep the areas.  But set things back to orginal base code.  Trust me it was the shit back in
the day.  Maybe not extreams that it was but thats what i see and seen. Oh yea and kaz nothing but love baby.

The issue with gear will really be handled over time.
 
Current plans (subject to change) are to redo the world map, nuke
most of the current areas, and rebuild starting from there. Levelling
will be handled a little differently, as will gearing.
 
This, of course, takes time.
 
As for skills, I'm not sure I completely understand your position on the
subject. Are you saying we should give all your skills at a lower level? If
so, then the only thing that makes you more powerful as you level up is your
increased health pool. I think part of the fun of levelling that people enjoy
is getting that new skill. This was faded in the past due to the spells not
being very well balanced, so a few old skills tended to overpower most of your
new skills, but we are trying to restore that.
 
Could you clarify a bit more?

I disagree with the whole 'someone RPing good shouldn't be
able to use Dark XXXX' idea. Here is why:
 
If they are RPing good, they wouldn't use it because of RP.
 
They could also be RPing that they are bending the forces of
dark to serve the light.
 
 
Anyhow, this isn't a huge issue. Its a simple renaming, if it
needs to be done. Neutral names like "divine," "godly," etc could
be subbed in easily. As for allowing align to change, it could be
done. I personally just don't think it's worth it, or needed.
 
 
This mud is primarily an RP mud. I'd really like to get us to where
that is actually true. In the past, this mud has really been a pk
mud. And while I love pk, and want it to be part of the game, I want
teamwork, rp, and other things to play large parts as well.
 
Align FORCES a certain kind of unchanging rp, without immortal intervention.
I'd really like to remove that so players can have more freedom to shape their
own RP as they see fit, and perhaps later, on a larger scale.

Sorry for my absence, sadly it will continue until I figure out wtf is going on with my video game. Anyways...
 
 
Alignment and spells, I am leaning more towards Exaethians idea. Here is my reasoning:
 
 
Say your an evil aligned cleric, or someone rping an "evil" person that just so happens to be a cleric.
Would someone who is "evil" consider themselves evil? I don't think so. I mean look at people in the real world,
everyone has different views on life, and stuff that I may see as evil, others don't. Lets take abortion for an example.
Some people see abortion as murder/evil, and some people see it as the opposite. See what I mean?
 
The description of clerics and paladins for example is that they derive their powers from THEIR god. So a "evil" cleric
could still get a "holy" aura from it's god, because accordingly to its' god that cleric is a holy pawn/servant. It all depends
on how it is viewed.  So thats my two cents on that subject.
 
 
One more thing, are we working on a website? If so i'm still waiting on what you all want me to do about the character sketches.

alot of the other class's, damage wise its great in the lower - mid lvls
and critical strike is hella awesome when yur fighting things lower lvl 
than you but, go up against anything bigger than yurself ie: pvp....or just
a stupid aggro that has a couple lvls on ya and yur critical stike isnt 
cutting it..
I suggest monk buff spells, to the tune of what the necromancer has
for their hand to hand style. It shouldnt be anything to the tune of
chance of paralyzing, prolly a noticable damage swing, for a first..
a silence for the second, and maybe some kinda elemental attack for
a third buff.....
 
but anyways, i do believe that thats all the class is really missing, and
a few buff skills should stretch prolly from 50ish - 70+....
thats all i have for now and i hope to check out some of the other class's to
post some ideas.

Being a dwarf, I get to think about drinking a lot.  As it
stands, the current "drunk" code is really, really bad.  I
remember the older drunk code that just slurred your speech.
Somehow, it got changed to just spitting out random lines of
MUD code, so you can't even halfway make out what the person
is saying.  Letters, numbers, brackets...it's all kinda crappy.
Maybe there was a reason behind changing it...I really don't
know.
 
 
Also, a clerical spell called "Sobriety" would be cool.  Could
also make potions of it called "hot coffee".  :-D

Subject Monks, crits and drunkeness.~

Drunkeness always been screwy. BUT for how good dwarf drunk racial is, there will always be a downside to it. After all
you hit a bit harder then a medium (human sized) race, get more hits per second because your a small race, and drunk also
makes you take less damage. Stacked with sanc its way cool. So with all the benefits there must be a downside. Granted
the downside of slurred speach is stupid. So give ideas for new downside and we may change.
 
 
Critical strike and monks:
 
This is fine, critical strike works how it should, perhaps give a slightly higher chance when fighting something the same level 
as you, but you should not be criting the shit out of stuff higher than you.
 
Now for monks, this has been debated and thought about since monks became a class. A long time ago I was a leading monk 
character, 81 and all, and had the best gear. Monk damage is weird, but only because of the dam type and the npcs you are facing.
 
It was talked about a while back not giving monks stuff that silences and what not, that could be potentially OP, instead a quick fix
was to give monks a way to change damage type. Titanium Fists, Burning Hands, etc. etc. 
 
 
Changing dam type may improve their damage, if not then look into other alternative routes. But changing damtype
on the class that hits alot could cause a big tip in how good they are....
 
 
Anyways, go ahead, talk about it, post notes. blah blah
 
 
Side note, I am not officially back yet. Got a bunch of animations dumped on me. Falling behind on animations for my 
video game ..... So ill only be checking in time to time. Gonna try talking to exa about helping a small amount on new skills
when I can.
