Subject skills, spells, races, classes~
Text
Ok, heres the deal. I can start coding now starting tonight. From what I understand
is wanting to be done, Zalev wants me to get some Q and A from the players, current and
any prospective. He wants to see what it is the players would like to see implemented to
make the game more desirable to play. Right now as far as I know I am to look in to making
atleast two (2) new classes and i would like to look at adding two (2) more races as well.
 
I have some ideas of my own for races, but once again, I would like to hear from the players.
 
Once I get a good look at the skill and spell codes of the existing spells, I should be able
to code some new ones (i want to see how the old ones are coded for two reasons):
 
1. I know more python code than I do C, python has similar roots which means that C isn't hard
to reproduce through python knowledge. So viewing the code will make it easier.
 
2. In my opinion, it would possibly make it easier for later coders (I.E. Kazmir) to mess with
any code I implement if it is set up in a similar fashion to the existing.
 
 
You probably don't care about that part, but I am trying to keep you guys informed and more
involved.
 
 
While I am doing this, I would REALLY like you guys to either post your ideas, and then comment
on eachothers ideas on the boards. If I am online, feel free to just say them over oov and such
and I will write them down in a file.
 
 
This is the most important step.
 
 
After everything is squared away, I would also like input on what people would like to see as high
and low level spells. If you like how it is currently set up, then good. But more than likely some
spells may get tweaked (if Zalev and/or Kazmir desire it) to help balance the classes some more.
 
 
I would like to see the classes balanced more so that people will want to play all the classes, 
instead of just a few.
 
 
FEEDBACK FEEDBACK FEEDBACK. Thats what I need the most.
 
 
Thank you :P

Subject Good News?~
Text
Umm.. good news and bad news.
 
 
The good news is, you may not have to wait for new races and classes right off the bat lol.
I have been doing some poking around and it ends up that there were races and classes that
have been hiding in the code that were just never activated.  I can list them if you would like
More good news, this means that if these class names and balances arent liked, I just have to
tweak them a put by changing variables isntead of writing new lines.
 
 
Bad news:
 
 
The code is all messy like, and I found the code for the race/classes, now I gotta dig up the part
that lets me place it on the creation list.
 
 
Once again, list any race/classes you want to see, And if you want, I'll list the ones that
I found that could be enacted as soon as I find the other file, if Zalev wants.

Subject Ideas~
Text
I spoke with Jon last night about some ideas for the mud. Here is what I came up with, although
they may be a little far fetched at the moment.
 
1. Redo the entire world map. Divide it into several areas, to limit summoning. Place ALL levelling
mobs on the world map. Remove all worthless areas. Areas will then be only dungeons for gear/RP,
and cities.
 
2. Rebalance existing spells. Reassign the spells to the classes. This isn't hard to do. I can
write a simple equation to get this done.
 
3. On re-organizing skills to classes: I'd like to see things like clerics be almost purely defensive,
and mages almost purely offensive. Other classes around similar models. The upside would be every class
would have a definite strength and a definite weakness. Clerics would be nearly impossible to kill, but
they really couldn't kill you either. Mages would be deadly at attacking, but every bit as vulnerable
to attack. Things like charm would have to be limited. It's WAY too powerful.
 
4. Perhaps a new leveling system. Lower the amount of xp you get from killing npcs. Make XP be also gained
4. Perhaps a new leveling system. Lower the amount of xp you get from killing npcs. Make XP be also gained
from using your skills. While slower, and bot-able (we can limit this as well, very easily), it would allow
the defensive, cant kill shit classes to still level.
 
More XP from higher level skills, of course.
 
 
5. Remove all limits from gear. The only limited gear should be quest gear.
 
6. Remove PK looting. This is something that I don't suggest lightly, as it was my main way of gearing up
a character, but it's honestly pretty dumb that I could get all the best gear in the game without killing
a single one of the NPCs for it, while the people who did kill the NPCs ended up just getting depressed.
 
7. Put in a PK reward system to compensate. Perhaps similar to WoW's honor system. Points for killing other
players, which can be cashed in for items.
 
8. Creative, fun ways to reward and encourage RP. This is an RP mud, afterall.
 
 
9. New races, New classes, New skills.
 
10. VERY important, after we remove all the unnecessary areas, rebalance the ones we have. Gear, NPCs, all 
of it. And then we need STRICT builder guidelines for the future.
 
 
Also, for a policy, we should try to start letting the players have a little more control. Especially over
the RP. It gets them more involved, and makes them feel like a bigger part of the picture. It also makes
it so that we don't need to rush a new area just to keep people interested, and thus limits the opportunities
for someone to sneak a piece of cheat gear, or NPC into the game.

Subject Classes~
Text
The existing classes have a LOT of overlap. I have a suggestion to the
rest of the immortal staff to kind of "Theme" the classes, making them
excel at some things, fail at others. My primary example is the cleric
and the mage.
 
The cleric would become almost entirely defensive, very very difficult
to kill. But they would have so little offense, it would be very very
difficult for them to kill anyone else as well.
 
The mage would become the polar opposite. The deadly, direct destruction
spell caster. But they would have little defense, making them very
susceptible to attack as well.
 
Sounds great to me, in theory. However, we have a LOT of classes, and each
would need to be defined along these lines. They don't have to be black
and white, nor purely damage based assumptions. The thief, for instance,
seems like it should be much less a combat oriented class, and more a
class designed to COMPLETELY avoid combat.
 
Anyhow, I'd like to know what people think not only about the idea, but
about how the classes roles should be assigned. What they should be good
at, what they should fall to. etc.

Subject Clerics~
Text
Ok, bit off subject from the whole redoing classes (and especially clerics from the looks of it).
I have been wondering what restoring light did that was different from rejuvination... and I found it lol.
 
 
 
It seems that restoring light is almost like an immortal restore command. It not only regens all of your
hp, but it also removes poisons and plague. This seems to be the only thing so far, it will not cancel
slow, corruption, etc. But it does seem that it does have an added bonus.
 
 
Although this seems to be a bit of a crock for how much more it costs mana wise than casting cure disease
and rejuiv and such separate. Ideas are always wanted to improve things.d
 
 
As for clerics being ultimate defense and mages being ultimate damage. I said in earlier note I do what Zalev
tells me, and so far he says listen to the ideas and majority. So sounds good, keep ideas coming. Only thing
I would add in to that idea of ultimate defense and offensive spell casters... Would you want them to be 
completely like that now? or would you rather they become completely those roles when there are more players
to group with.
 
 
My reasoning being is that are those classes going to be pretty impossible to level solo should they be that
way. This isn't my mud so obviously I'm not going to be a jerk off and say "no" to ideas lol, but I would hate
to see two of the most popular classes so far become the two least used classes because of lack of pbase.
 
Just a thought tho...

Subject Classes~
Text
So, here is what I came up with for classes.
 
The idea is that we have 5 "base" classes, and then the hybrids for each. Other
classes are unique 'outlier' classes (we have a LOT of these, from what I see.
 
I'm using this template to help rearrange the skills that the classes will have,
and help suggest new classes that could be made. Here is what I have for existing:
 
Base -
Warrior, Cleric, Mage, Thief, Maligner
 
Hybrids-
Battle Mage (Warrior/Mage)
Paladin (Warrior/Cleric)
Ranger (Warrior/Thief)
Black Knight (Warrior/Maligner)
Shaman (Mage/Cleric)
Spellfilcher (Mage/Thief)
Witch/Warlock (Mage/Maligner)
Inquisitor (Cleric/Thief)
Shadowmancer (Cleric/Maligner)
Diabolik (Thief/Maligner)
 
Of course, there are some classes in there that we don't have yet (Battle Mage,
Witch/Warlock, Shadowmancer, Diabolik), so those are the new classes I'd suggest
immediately (Names subject to change).
 
The remaining classes we have are the unique classes, and any class we make from
here on out would likely be as well, although we could introduce another base
class and make the appropriate hybrids as well.

Contested it at first, but new evidence makes me back the decision.
 
 
For further notice. Should you be hired to build an area for one reason or another
DO NOT place in items that give only certain classes one ups, especially your own.
 
Also, don't make the items only accessible to certain classes, aka gate. And one
last thing, don't give items spells that belong to only certain classes for a reason
aka, complete heal.

Sadly, I gotta find where the code for excalibur is screwed up.... the oprog looks fine to bring you back to

Well, now that that's solved, I would like to see if we would be able to get enough people (possibly the
tiny pbase that we have) to be able to get online for a possible quest involving this item (and more) that
I have found while digging around at items.  There are several possible quest items that could be handed out.
Also, there could be costume quest items (ones that the mortal could come up with within reason) that could
be assigned as prizes.
 
 
Being that I used to hate being in quests and coming out empty handed for not winning, I would also like to
put out that should a quest take place, it would only be fair that everyone get a kind of parting gift, some
sort of quest item that everyone would enjoy.
 
 
What's your thoughts? interested?

Subject the quest (no time set yet)~
Text
Level will not matter (to an extent) everyone will get a base reward, and in accordance to level you will get
an item. I did have a thought though, that maybe the item can be updated (if you win one that is) so that you
are not stuck with a piece of shinny junk at 81 because u quested at 30.
 
 
Also, I am trying to plan the quest not around complete brute strength. Maybe riddles, maybe a maze, who knows.
 
 
Bare with me, it will take a little while to get this going, I just started classes and banks have been dicking
around with my financial aid, but within a week it will all be settled down and back to the daily grind lol.
(not to mention got hooked up from a professor and given credit for a class I never took, so work load was
decreased by 3 credit hours :D).
 
 
Anyways, I'll keep you posted, feel free to post any ideas you would like to see for the quest, afterall, you
are going to be the ones doing the quest, not me.

Text
Ok, bad news. I just had my first day of class in my Advanced gaming and bullshit class. Looks like
my assignment is going to be me and 4-5 other people have to make a damn video game using Unreal Engine....
 
So in other words, here within a week or so I won't be on as much, or looking in to the code as much.
 
I will however still work on shit whenever the classes are finished being messed with so that we can get
everything more balanced and user friendly. This doesn't mean I give up, just a small set back.
 
 
I find out what I am assigned to here in a few weeks, I'm hoping to get to create weapons and vehicles, because
I'm best at it, which means I can fly through my work and get done early... my luck will be that I get stuck
with environment or character creation.... which means  the first one is boring and slow to do, and the second is
slow and I don't know alot about it still.... so it'll take more time. Dependent on which I get, is how long I will
be absent at times.

Subject Classes~
Text
Just so you know what some of the classes will look like:
 
Base classes:
 
Warrior - Melee combatant. Master of Traditional Warfare.
Cleric - Diviner of the Gods. Defensive. Healer.
Mage - Channeller of Arcane destructive powers. Direct damage caster.
Thief - Uh...a thief. Tries to avoid combat or escape it. Steals. Gathers information.
Maligner - The "piss you off" debuff class. Specializes in making you suck, rather than
       overpowering you.
 
 
Hybrids:
 
Paladin - Holy Warrior. (Cleric/Warrior)
Ranger - Sneaky Warrior/Wilderness Warrior (Warrior/Thief)
Black Knight - Debuffing melee class. (Warrior/Maligner)
Shaman - Uses the arcane to bend the elements to do their bidding. (Mage/Cleric)
Spellfilcher - Disloyal, sneaky caster (Mage/Thief)
Inquisitor - The 'something is not right with this one' healer (Cleric/Thief)
 
 
We have plans to introduce hybrids for Warrior/Mage, Mage/Maligner, Cleric/Maligner, and Thief/Maligner
in the (hopefully near) future.
 
 
The other classes we have are regarded as 'outlier classes,' or unique classes. They aren't hybrids,
and will tend to work on different mechanics. This hybrid system is as close to 'dual classes' as we
currently offer, so I wanted to make sure we had at least a little bit of this in here.
 
 
Anyways, back to it!

That's all the Base and Hybrid classes that are currently in.
 
Unique classes will only be changed slightly, for the most part.
They will NOT get a spell before a base class does, so there may be some
changes with what level they get things. And they may lose some skills
for balance purposes (portal, gate, etc). But it shouldn't be much.

Subject Spell Balance~
Text
So, I'm going to begin trying to go through our spells and
normalizing their damage. The objective here is to keep spell
damage from getting out of control, but also to make sure that
the spell you pick up at level 50 isn't being outdone by the
spell you've had since level 20. Each additional spell should
be at least a minor upgrade from the one a level before it.
 
The first step in this was making the hybrids and unique classes
attain spells at the same level or after the base classes do.
 
Now, I am looking to finalize a generic damage equation for the
damage a spell does. We can make lots of factors affect this,
but things that definitely will affect it are current level,
the level the base class attains the spell, and the randomness
of the code generated "dice."
 
The dice are the tricky part. If you use a low number of dice
with a high number of faces on those dice, the damage varies
greatly. If you use a high number of dice with few faces, the
damage is more static. We also have the option of adding
modifiers after/before the dice to help attain more static
numbers, or just a large base value.
 
So, for now I will give you the damage example of Acid Blast
in its current form: Damage = dice(level, 12)
 
The damage is decided by a "dice" roll of (your level) number of
dice that have 12 sides. (That or its 12 dice with (your level)
number of sides. To be perfectly honest, I'm not 100% :P). I'd
like to change this to something more along the lines of:
Damage = (base class level attained) * dice(level, level/6)
 
This is just an example.
 
The thing to keep in mind, is that MOST spells will use whatever
generic equation we come up with. So keep that in mind as you make
suggestions.

As for the FoKing Website the problem we are having is that
Kazmir set up the website (so he says) to be able to be edited
just like OLC.  He can not remember how to do it, explorer does
not know how to do it and I can not figure it out.  So I can talk
to Explorer about taking that down and putting a FoKing website
up if anyone has any Web editing software we can use.  I used
to be able to do it freehand but I was 13-14 with no friends
sitting home on the night of homecoming playing with myself...
i mean...umm...nevermind that....but i forgot is the point.
 
As for the language, why cant we stick with Kazinglish? I kinda
like it...
 
That was a joke....and if any of you see Kazinglish in the game
please note where you saw it so i can fix it and be as detailed
about it as you can.
 
But Marius look in the code and see if you can find/figure out the
website or im going to ask Explorer to redo it all for us so we can
edit it.

Text
The equation I am thinking of using is this:
 
((Learned Level * Current Level)/10) + dice(15, 10).
I'd have to see exactly how it works in the code, however, the basic
structure makes it so spells hit for approximately the same all
the time (can vary by 150 damage), and of course they scale with your
level as well as the level the base class learns the skill.
 
Initial numbers show that Acid Blast at level 30 (when a mage learns
it) would hit for 105-240 (172.5 average), and for 258-393
(323.5 average) at level 81. Storm Vengenace, by contrast, would
hit for 633-798 (730.5 average) at level 81.
 
 
 
Thoughts?

First the up side/down side. I work retail and for some reason they are being dickholes and cut my hours back to weekends
only, good for the mud, bad for me. So i am looking for other places of employment and stumbled acrossed a position with the
University. It seems that the spot i am interning for (no pay) may have a paying spot opening up (the current paid tech is slacking
and not doing his job/ leaving his post early, so I met with the lead tech and he said he may fire the other guy and hire a new one...
hopefully me :)) which means ill be in a lab more often, i.e: more coding time PLUS i get paid to do it from the school lol.
 
 
so there is the ups and downs. Shitty scheduling, but if it all works out i may actually indirectly get paid to code/ be on here.

Eh, most mage spells are done except for magic missile, multi

Misery is a new Damage over Time spell currently
available for Maligners and Black Knights.
 
The strength of Misery and Corruption may be altered soon,
I need to see how they work out.
 
 
Special thanks to Kazmir for filling in the blanks when I
started punching my screen trying to figure out what was
wrong with the spell :P

Subject Heals~
Text
Cure light, Cure Serious, Cure Critical, Heal, Restoration,
and Rejuvinate have been altered. They should actually heal
for more now. Levels altered accordingly.
 
Info on Restoring Light:
It looks to heal and restore mana to the target, at the
expense of the casters mana. It also removes the affects
of Blind, Curse, Poison, Plague, Misery, and Hellfire.

Cleric defensive spells (and, of course, the hybrids that

While I still would like people to submit feedback on the
skills already in the game that have been altered, and the
new ones I've put in, I'd like to hear ideas for high level
skills for the classes that don't yet have them.
 
These skills will be the unique skills each class gets. The
ones that really separate the different classes at max level.
 
Submit ideas!

Fairie Fire was meant to be a spell that kept you from
being invisible...if you have the firey aura around you
then you are still able to be seen.  It is an attack spell
not a buff.  As for the other they are restored to saved
death file.

Ok SO. Schools slowing down a little, the long drag to midterms is passed and I'm all caught up on my animations.
 
So that means, I am semi BACK :D. I will be getting ahold of my brother here soon to get the programs I need to start
messing around with the code again.  
 
For everyone who doesn't know, MW2 (Modern Warfare 2) comes out next Tuesday at midnight (monday pretty much)
so I will more than likely NOT be on late late at night, because that is my shoot up terrorists time. So if you have any
requests for things to be done, or things to be fixed, pls submit them before you log off for the day and I will get to them
in the AM.
 
 
 
Thank you for your cooperation. Now, SUBMIT IDEAS AND GET MORE PLAYERS.
 
 
Oh yeah, btw, how many players do we have now? I have heard mixed information, but when I log on I see none.

Subject Master Host Downtime...~
Text
Greetings,
 
As you know, Fate has been a little sketchy lately, but...
 
It is not Fate itself (atleast this time :P) that is down,
but instead because work is being done on the master host,
that hosts the Fate server itself, and as such, it is not
always something Fate Mud Admins can do very much about,
other than bug me, to get it fixed or such... which Z does
very nicely...  :)
 
Recently the Host server has undergone 2 system restores, 
(no date lost on fate server though) which has caused some
troubles and downtime, it "should" be more stable as it is
currently...  but at some point, the upgrade will be retried
again on the Host server.
 
Keep in mind though, this isnt a commercial hosting center
that fate is kept on though, but i do try and help Kaz with
hosting Fate (have hosted fate for a zillion years it feels
like :P) and for free even :)
 
If anyone is interested, Fate ISP lines are 50/50Mbit Fiber
lines and is hosted on a Virtual Linux Box.
 
Thanks for your time if you read to here ;P

it took me a bit to find your file, for some reason there was no backup in delete
or balefire, probably because I think you were removed in some other manor, neways...
 
Your character was saved in a death back up, i restore and healed u, however you were
carrying way too much weight for me to give u your backpack (for some reason it wouldnt
restore you with all your equipment store in the file, so I was giving it to you) I
attempted to force you to take the backpack... but it caused the mud to crash.
 
 
 
Which brings me to side note: All imms, force is broke, it crashes the mud. I think it's
linked to misery bugs, but not sure.
