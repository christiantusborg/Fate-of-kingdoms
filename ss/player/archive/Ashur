Desc Before you stands a huge being.  His skin is a pale yellow color
and his eyes are greener than the deepest green leaves in the forest.
His hair is white and has been cut short in preperation for battle. 
Dispite his muscular tone his face is very square.  Muscles all over
his body protrude out showing big lumps through his clothes.  Many
scars cover his body but the one that stands out the most is a
circular one on his cheek with burn scars around it from a past
battle with the Ultimate Warrior.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Ashur is a young giant born under the sign of the Angel in the
land of Thera.  He grew up just south of the desert's just outside
the ruined city of Lankford.  As a child he used to take long strides
through the desert and stop at the gates to the ruined city.  The
guard there told him that he could not pass so he would walk around
its walls and look into the damned place.  One day as he was looking
from a distance he saw some devils come running out of the city and
straight towards his hometown.  Ashur ran as fast as his huge legs
could carry him but he was just not fast enough.  When he got back to
his camp he found that the devils had killed everything in sight and
rummeged through everything.  Ashur walked slowly through the camp
and he came upon a few beat up pieces of armor that was just about
his size.  He picked them up and put them on and continued through
the camp.  Finally Ashur came upon his father, lying there grasping a
sword choking on his own blood.  His father put the sword in his
hands and told him to seek out a strong warrior that could help him
become best figher he could be.  Ashur took the time to burry his
father and then set out, no destination in mind, just started
walking, dragging the sword his father had given him too drained to
carry it.  A few weeks had passed and Ashur was looking for food and
he came upon a fighter in the woods.  The fighter had dissapeared
just as fast as he had appeard and as Ashur walked by where he
thought he had seen the fighter a knife was put to his throat.  Ashur
told the fighter that he was not wanting to be a bother just thought
he would talk to him.  The fighter removed the knife from his throat
and asked him what he wanted.  Ashur told him that he needed a place
to learn how to fight and become a great warrior.  The fighter
thought for a moment and told him that he would take him where he
took his daughter to train.  The fighter lead Ashur to a training
ground and told him that they would train him here.  Then his
daughter ran up excited to see him and show him some of her new
skills.  His father introduced her to Ashur, Bathilda this is the
giant Ashur.  He will be training here with you as well.  As they
learned Ashur and Bathilda became best friends.  They would team up
on everything they did.  Their Master was proud of the fact that they
would team up on everything and beat it the way they did.  Soon
enough he thought that they had learned all they could from him and
sent them on their way.
