Back IDIOTS & RETAIL
 
I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk
noticed that I had never signed my name on the back of the credit 
card. She informed me that she could not complete the transaction 
unless the card was signed. When I asked why, she explained that it 
was necessary to compare the signature on the credit card with the 
signature I just signed on the receipt. So I signed the credit card in 
front of her. She carefully compared that signature to the one I 
signed on the receipt. As luck would have it, they matched. 

IDIOTS & GEOGRAPHY

After interviewing a particularly short-spoken job candidate, I 
described the person to my boss as rather monosyllabic. My boss said, 
"Really? Where is Monosyllabia?". Thinking that he was just kidding, I 
played along and said that it was just south of Elbonia. He replied, 
"Oh, you mean over by Croatia?" 

ADVICE FOR IDIOTS

An actual tip from page 16 of the Hewlett Packard Environmental, 
Health & Safety Handbook for Employees: "Blink your eyelids 
periodically to lubricate your eyes." 

IDIOTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

I live in a semi-rural area. We recently had a new neighbor call the 
local township administrative office to request the removal of the 
Deer Crossing sign on our road. The reason: Many deer were being hit 
by cars and he no longer wanted them to cross there. 

IDIOTS & COMPUTERS

My neighbor works in the operations department in the central office 
of a large bank. Employees in the field call him when they have 
problems with their computers. One night he got a call from a woman in 
one of the branch banks who had this question: "I've got smoke coming 
from the back of my terminal. Do you guys have a fire downtown?" 

IDIOTS ARE EASY TO PLEASE

I was sitting in my science class, when the teacher commented that the 
next day would be the shortest day of the year. My lab partner became 
visibly excited, cheering and clapping. I explained to her that the 
amount of daylight changes, not the actual amount of time. Needless to 
say, she was very disappointed. 

IDIOTS IN FOOD SERVICE

My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco. She asked 
the individual behind the counter for "minimal lettuce." He said he 
was sorry, but they only had iceberg. 

AN IDIOT'S IDIOT

Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by placing a 
metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy 
machine. The message "He's lying" was placed in the copier, and police 
pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect wasn't 
telling the truth. Believing the "lie detector" was working, the 
suspect confessed.
