Desc Hathrin He appears to weigh 100 kilograms with well defined
muscles but little in the way of bulk.  His hair is a pale blonde and
reaches beyond his shoulders while his thick beard is a very light
red.  His eyes are an icy blue which never quite seem to focus where
he is looking.  Across his nose there are the faint marks of three
small scars which almost appear to have been made by some form of
claw. His wry smile seems to indicate a friendly nature.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Born in a distant land Hathrin's early upbringing remains shrouded
in mystery.  What is known is that his parents died forcing him to
become the bondsman of an eccentric Mage called Aldreth.  Aldreth
studied solely in the arts of translocation, his aim was to reach
other worlds for purposes known only to himself.  Hathrin was branded
in Aldreth's personal fashion, a deep scratch made by a small drake
somewhere on the bondsman's face, and sent to work ordering the
Mage's vast written volumes.  The task was never ending as Aldreth
was constantly requesting books and sending them back soon after, not
to mention his inability to decide between Alphabetical,
Numerological or Spell Potency as the organizing factor.  Hathrin
soon found that Aldreth rarely came to the Library personally and
took no notice of the mess as long as it was visibly being sorted. 
He utilized this knowledge spending long hours learning the
fundamentals of the Arcane.  It took ten long years of study and
cross referencing for Hathrin to even begin understanding how to
manipulate the energies of the world around him in even the most
minor form.  It also took ten years for Aldreth to have a late night
insight into his research and rush to the Library just in time to see
Hathrin conjure a small puff of light for mere moments.  Enraged at
his bondsman's pride Aldreth roared and lunged at Hathrin who
flinched backwards instinctively avoiding his master's grasp.  He
turned tail and fled into the night knowing that while Aldreth had no
truly offensive spells, he did have alot of failed 'dimension'
experiments Hathrin preferred not to remember.  Reaching the town of
Sanaria Hathrin began his new life as an adventurer vowing to one day
be the greatest Magician in all the Kingdoms!  
 
Soon after his vow Hathrin had learned more uses for magic than his old
master's tomes had ever indicated. He could now form projectiles made
entirely of magical forces and detect other users of magic who may otherwise
wish to remain hidden.
Overjoyed with these new found abilities Hathrin roamed Sanaria's streets
dispatching dogs, cats, pidgeons and if the chance arose criminals.
The equipment used by the latter assisted Hathrin in paying for food and
board as well as repairs for his own equiptment. For a time life was good.
