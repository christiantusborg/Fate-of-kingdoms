Cavapatti The Traveler~
A Traveling Priest stands here, proclaiming his poems.
~
{x A tall man from a far away land stands here, a thin figure
wearing odd garments from a distant land.  With long and cute curly
golden blonde hair, with a tall studded white and black hat on his
head, much like a cylander.  His robe matchs his hat, a black and
white robe with red spikes and stripes on the hemp like material.  As
a wanderer he also wears a set of heavy leather and brass armor
across his chest, with a set of scroll and book holders along his
back.  Along his slender legs are a pair of black clean pants,
similar to a bellbottom quality, and a pair of worn black shoes are
tightly wrapped around his well traveled feet.  Most would see him as
very charismatic, with his very gentle large brown eyes and a warm
smile on his cutely round face.

starch white apron.  However she has been looking depressed, somewhat
sickly and of ill-health as she sits alone on the docks every day.

rather skinny, but muscular and built despite his age.  His hair has
turned a full fledged grey and balding as most of the hair on the top
of his head has already fallen out, since then his hair frows out
wildly.  His face filled with wrinkles and his left eye has a big
black patch over it.  His jaw and chin tucks under as he lost most of
his teeth from scurvy.  He is dressed slightly better than a sailor,
in a stained white shirt with an apron and a pair of tattern blue
pants.

A younger woman sits behind the short-bar, greeting her customers.

medium tone despite her sunny disposition.  Her appearance is rather
attractive, as she shows it by wearing a fine form fitting dress of
well..  Blue!  That covers her body and a brilliant orange and purple
sarong that sashes across her torso.  She wears sandals on her feet,
showing her casualness around her bar of new and exotic antiquities.

ghastly pirate captain mulligan ruthless~
Captain Mulligan~
A ghastly pirate captain stands at the helm of the ship.
~
{x Before you towers a giant monster of a man, which is now more
monster than man.  He stands a tall six or seven paces tall, and a
wide full figured muscular being.  His body is but a mere corpse now,
with his face nothing but a skeleton but a beard of white and black
scragly hair is attatched to that jawline.  A giant curled moustache
sits above his wicked yellow grin.  Ontop of his head he wears a
pirate's tri-horn hat, marked with the insignia of his ship similar
to that of a jolly-roger.  He wears a dark blue jacket with patches
of red and dried blood, though most of his skin has melted away and
he has many bones with chunks of rotting green flesh still attatched
to them.  His clothes are very fancy though, that of a true pirate
captain.

The Cannoneer Pirate~
A gigantic shirtless zombie pirate stands before you.
~
{x What a gigantic beast!  He stands eight paces tall, with the
size of a double wide human.  His belly is huge, but he is completely
packed with muscle as well.  He goes around shirtless, as most of his
flesh is still intact, but a pale blueish color.  He wears a pair of
black above-ankle cut pants with a pair of suspenders around his
shoulders.  His head is bald, and his eyes are covered with a pair of
strange bifocals, and a scarf striped red, that covers his face.  His
muscles are larger than a giants, as he spent most of his alive days
slaving away in the canon room of the lockheart.

The Jaw-Breaker Pirate~
A freakish jawless pirate ungulates here, groaning.
~
{x A horrible looking pirate, with a near skeletal figure, with
thin green skin, clinging to the bones.  His jaw is ripped off, and
his horribly sharp teeth drip with ooze.  His eyes are pitch black
with beady yellow centers, gazing around for a next target.  His rips
poke through whatever left of his torso is, with a pair of black
pants and a belt straped to his abdomen.  His body was tattoo'd but
it is nothing much left after his body wasted away, he wore a white
shirt on his shoulders, but now is left is nothing but tattered cloth
wrapped around his shoulders.  His head is covered with sharp long
spikey looking hair, poking around a few feet, of ugly greenish blue
dark hair.

{x Here is the end of the boardwalk, where those 16 paced long
boards of hard wood stop and it ends to a few steps to the south
where the golden sandy beaches start.  The buildings along the North,
in a wall like fashion end.  To the East is a short wooden gate, only
about waist high with little metal wires blocking off a sand and
grass path to the East.

a large sixteen step long with a well fitting parrellel persausian. 
While the boardwalk is perpendicular to all the buildings which are
built ontop of the sandy grass area, risen alittle above, in tall
plastered fashions.  Here, the sidewalk may end, but an entrance to
the golden warm sands lead to the south, while a large brick road
sits to the north.

{x This is where the sidewalk ends, where Portstreet is no more. 
The fine gray lumpy bricks which are laid out for a street and
sidewalk soon come to a neat closure.  Beyond there is a small
building of a hay thatch roof cottage, hanging over the land with a
few yellow boulders blocking off the planes behind it.  Though the
street ends, there are steps to the west, only a mere two or three
steps that leads down to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.

port, with shops linning up and down the east wall of buildings, made
from all shapes and sizes.  The road along here is made of a hearty
gray brick, the size of giant potatoes which are well formed together
cover the land to make a sturdy sidewalk and a road.  To the West can
be seen the sea, hanging past the giant set of docks at the wharf. 
To the Direct east from here is an old wooden shack of a building,
with large windows with compasses and anchors and more nautical
supplies hanging in it.

many feet above the beach like ground below is a well inset stone
made into a road and sidewalk.  Buildings line up along the East to
make a large wall of tightly compact thin but tall buildings.  The
Building to the East has a large sign hanging above it that says "Pet
Shop" with a few windows of painted animals and a few cages in the
windows with small animals displayed there.

on the scene from the wharf to the West.  Large tall buildings lie to
the East, tightly compact together and tightly pressed up along the
wide sixteen pace wide road and sidewalk made of a well compressed
gray stone like brick.  To the East seems to be an old wooden
building with the sign "Ship Wright's" with a large building
seemingly scattered with papers inside.

wharf of ships where hundreds of boats park in the grand structure of

beautiful view of the sea, especially during sunset.  To the East
here is a large grocer set in neighbooring all the buildings.  Huge
buckets and barrels and crateloads of food sit displayed here
underneaht the canopies which are next to the doors which are always
open to the public.

enough for the thick gray stones used for the sidewalk and road to be
beaten down.  Many travelers come from many ships walk these roads,
comming from the West Wharf.  The East side of the road is completely
lined with tightly packed shops, This place here seems to be a light
tan building with small windows conviently drawn into looking like a
giant map.

{x The smell of salty seawater was in the air, but now it just
wreaks!  The smell of fish is dominate here, maybe it was because of
the fishmarket that sits here along the gray stone path.  The
building is half open, and seems to be closeable, nothing more than a
booth with large cases full of fish sitting on icy cold waters and
platters sit here, even large barrells sit out near the street filled
with fresh live fish.  Large canopies sit overhead while in
operation, inviting people to step closer to the open fish market.

links the Port and Harbor street, both equally wide roads with
sidewalks on the side.  The buildings are of all shapes and sizes,
all salty looking white plaster building with hay and straw roofs or
worn bark wood roofs with chimneys and smokestacks.

you presently stand upon, goes onto the harbor which beyond that is
the sea which goes on endlessly into the horizon.  The sunsets in
that direction, with the shadows of the sails of the boats dancing
every evening.  Along this long stretching stone street are a line of
salty old buildings, slightly eroded from the sea-air, and here to
the right is one of the saltiest buildings, an old cottage looking
building with the wooden sign labled "The Grand Mariner" hangs above
the wooden door, people appear to be in it at all times, though it is
dark and scruffy looking.

grassy area, at least five or six paces above the ground as it
quickly stretches out westard to the sea and the boardwalk with the
old docks.  A small handrail is the only thing blocking off the docks
to the west which stretchs north to south with only a few entry
points.  To the East, one of the main buildings is an old shop, with
white walls with wooden frames, and a wooden sign that hangs overhead
that reads Bait and Tackle.

handrail keeps people from jumping down there, although a few steps
is all it takes.  To the East here are aligned many many buildings,
the one here seems to be a tall roofless building, with large books
set up into the tiny windows here, labled right next to the wooden
door inside.

road, nearly the size of the entire city would be the wharf to the
West, where a few steps down leads you to a series of planks which
form together , floating over the water many steps to form docks. 
While to the North here, is a stone walkway which leads through the
town, with many white and wood buildings line up along the East, many
canopies and signs sit there to show that there are many shops. 
However, there is a section of toad headed to the East for a small
roadway, and to the South can barely be seen a beach.

garbage cans settle here, settled ontop of the gray brick sidewalk

corner.  The road here is made of a fine lumpy gray stone which
create a sidewalk and a road to walk upon.  Inbetween the crampt
buildings are small patches of grass and an occassional tree, as
everything else is covered with bricks and stones.

stones making a fine sidewalk and road, while to the south turns into
a perpendicular road of hardwood planks for a boardwalk.  Many
buildings sit aligned to the street, cutting corners and looking
rather crowded.

The End of the Docks~
{x One of the short docks are what you currently stand upon, made
of worn wood, eroded from the salty water, but it is sturdy.  It is
quite large, enough for a large wagon to even fit on.  The dock
stands at least six paces above sealevel, with thick logs that go
under of who knows how deep into the dark blue, the sides of the logs
covered with green moss and barnicals.  At the end of this Dock,
there are a handrail, which gaurds it, looking out to the sunset.

The Beach~
{x After taking a few steps off the north wooden boardwalk, stands
you now at the beach!  A warm breeze flows through the air, though
not a completely tropical one.  The sands are a gold color, not as
pleasent as the white sands but they are warm and clean none-the
less.  The waters here are also exceptional, clean blue waters that
are almost clear, with no dead fish or wads of seaweed in the salty
waters to the south.

The Beach~
{x The warm golden sands here are quite comfortable, not as white
and clean as the sands to the south beaches but nor does the sand
burn the feet.  The sand is clear from any obstruction of bush or
weeds, making the clean blue waters want to greet the warm sandy
beach even the more.  A large strange type of tree grows here, and
along the entire beach it seems to be the only one of its kind.  It
is a tall tree, with strange light tan barn, and the only leaves that
grow on it are the top palm like leaves, with little brown balls
growing by them.

sand is a golden color unlike the beautiful white sands of the South,
but it is a fine grit sand, as no bushes or greens grow through it. 
The peach is a long seventy steps while the cool blue waters rush
back and forth to meet the sand.

small spaces for alleyways, all crowded together in tall two story
straw-roof cottages, thin in size but quite quaint.  Here is hte area
of a large clearing with a small fountain and flowergarden to attract
people to this center square.  Unlike most squares, this one lacks a
fountain, but rather has a massive marble statue which stands errect
in the center of the square, the size of a regular human, only on a 2
foot tall memorial plaque box.

rock for a sidewalk and a road.  On either side of the road are

twist and wind upwards in a manipulation which spiral into more and
more shops.  Large lanterns hang from each shop door-side, to keep

it is a two story building made of wood, large potted plants out in
front and a small canopy where a few chairs sit.  This appears to be

The Grand Mariner~
What a joint, the entire building had that old rusty and worn look
to it, as is the entire building, the walls were made of old salty
planks of wood, half erroded from age.  All the tables were round and
nearly a dozen of them set all around that leads to a large wooden
bar in the back.  It appeared to be a larger place than it looked
from outside, with almost a full bar full of salty sailors and
patrons who give the bar life.  Hanging on those rusty walls are
sailor's memorabelia, pictures of boats, old bouyies, and stuffed
fish hanging here and there.  Along the West wall are two windows
along side the one wooden door with a bell attatched, ringing every
time a customer enters.  Other than the three windows only tiny
candles sitting on the tables and a tiny chandelier light this entire
building during the day.

The Grand Mariner~
{x Slowly going further back to the bar, past the old wooden
tables, nothing in this bar seemed excessively fancy as all objects
in the bar were made of old creeky wood, the tables, chairs, walls
and even floor - making a loud creek as people step on it.  The smell
is somewhat salty and has a strong odor of a dark rum that levitates
over the bar where the tender stands with awide array of barrels and
bottles of alcohal.  It is a "lively" place as there are many patrons
sitting around but none of the patrons were by any means lively, all
of the patrons sitting and grunting veteran sailors, drinking their
precious grog as you pass.

The Dolphin's Play-ground~
{x The doorway was the entire length of the building, which is
only a tiny twenty something paces, but a two step tall curtain hangs
down from the short doorway.  But once stepping in it is like an
entirely new enviornment, with only two or three short wooden
organically shaped tables and small blue pillows to sit upon, and a
long short bar sits along the North wall with pillows on the ground
to sit upon.  Everything along the backwall sits on large shelves,
many colorful elixers and foreign beverages from the newest and most
exotic countries.  The Place is well lit and fresh air blows through,
colorful arrays dance around as candles sit in their rainbow
stainglass candleholders.

there, getting their sunlight from the large windows that sit to the
South, allowing the view of the ocean into this resort.  The floor is
of a rare red carpet looking well traveled as many people obviously
stay here.  The area seems to be two stories as the ceiling is as
taller than a giant, with a large chandalier hanging from the
ceiling, keeping the bottom floor lit.  A catwalk for the floors can
be seen overhead, with their carven wooden handgaurds.  To the North
can be seen the front Desk and a set of stairs that leads upwards.

The Royal Windage Resort~
{x Going further into the Resort Main floor, there appear to be no
rooms but rather up the stairwell onto the catwalk like floor appear
to be hard oak doors leading into the rooms.  A large chandelier
hangs overhead to keep this entire building lit, the lights shinning
of the fancy white wallpapers.  The floor is made of a well used red
carpet - showing that many boots and shoes have seen their way to
walk across it.  Here sits the wooden checkin desk, a simple mediocre
desk with a large wooden cabinet behind it.

grand round tables, sturdy and flat with white and pink tablecloths
draped over them.  Large Windows face both South and West towards the
sea, flooding in the lightto this resort resturaunt.  The Carpet here
is a strange striped and dotted carpet of a faded red color, having a
few stains once spilled on it every now and again, but the smell is
incredible as the chefs work hard and labor away at the kitchen.  Up
front is a small wooden podium where the waiter stands waiting to
seat their guests.

off any trail to the city, and the lead to the East with a small dirt
trail which winds through the forested area.  Very little sits around
other than a patch of wild flowers or a boring mound of dirt here and
there.  Though the fresh air blows through the wild flowers, giving a
peaceful aroma to the sections here.

needs to be swept.  The set of latters begin right past that hard
wooden door, protruding out of the wall and spiraling upwards through

Business District Square~
{x So many shops surrounding this area, the road turns into a dead
end if not ending before turning into a grand cul-de-sac.  Where
buildings of all shapes and sizes surround the square of dark gray
brick roads and sidewalks completely, a giant lamp post sitting in
the center lighting the square up during the night or foggy times. 
The smell of wood and linen hang heavy in the air as a textile shop,
weavery, and furniture store sit close to the square.

The Torspoon Furniture~
{x Here is a crowded little shop, but not crowded with people. 
Inside the furniture store is a well lit building, provided by the
large windows to the south, which cover the whole wall.  Inside is a
well decorated building, of a striped light gray wallpaper, and a
shiny wooden floor.  Everywhere can be seen tables and chas stacked
up upon one another, nearly three stacks of chairs that push up to
the ceiling of hay and straw, which are also covered with boards of
wood across the rafters.

The Torspoon Textile~
{x Here is a different looking building, organic in a way.  A
curvacious room with shelves built into the wall with large dome like
windows bulging out, and large open spots in the walls for sunlight
to the flow in and let fresh air from the sea to blow in.  Around
back there is a small exit door, but infront of that is the main
desk, while there are large artistic curving shelves that hold pounds
upon pounds of different silks, cottons, linens, and almost every
other materials around, and even foreign materials from the harbor. 
Large piles of unshaven cotton sit losely in giant piles laying
around as do buckets of dyes and giant weaving machines and potted
cotton plants.

The Torspoon Weavery~
{x Here is a pleasent place, with a double wide door which is
usually left open to the public.  And a large building with white
walls and hard wood floors.  It appears to be doing well in business,
with many tapestries hanging all ocver the walls, and piles of
different rugs, towels, and hangers of racks of clothes sitting
around the building with a large opening in the center of the room
leading straight to the main desk.

The Elders House~
{x Here is the lobby to the house so to speak, Through this room
is the kitchen in the south, along the north of the house, where a
small area full of pots and pans and a tiny tiny pantry lays within. 
Here, after a small brick walkway entrance are hard wooden floors,
with a few chairs and a few pots full of giant ferns sit, next to the
windows as the light pours onto them.

The Elders House~
{x The elder's home, the main room where the elder likes to stand.
A large rug of strange dark colors and patterns sit infront of the
large fireplace, seemingly the meeting place for the council as it is
just a large empty spot in the house.  A few large house chairs sit
on the far edge of the room along with a small desk with drawers.  A
large set of stairs sit along the south wall far away from the
fireplace, leading to the upstairs room.

{x Here is the top floor of the elders house, it seems to be a set
of rooms and a small hallway, each bedroom has a large white bed with
a natural looking wooden bedframe.  Large windows to shower in the
light into their rooms.  A small bedside table accompanies their
beds, with a large bowl of water set upon each one.  A large wooden
cabinet sits here, locked.  The only way out is the set of stairs

The Municipal Building~
{x Here is the Municipal building, the building is made of evenly
rectangular bricks, covered with a fine white plaster, leaving a
large room and a locked doorway of a double set of doors to the East.
A large red red carpet leads that way.  But infront of that is a
small wooden desk made for the receptionist.  Nothing much else is in
this room other than a few short brown urns with large green plants
growing out and a few busts of the mayor on stone pedastals beside to
double doors.

but only one floor.  A giant room is here with a huge wooden desk and
a small rug infront of it.  Huge windows sit along the North wall
behind the desk, all the light shinning to the south, which a small
set of chairs and a small couch sit.  The entire building is made
from light gray bricks and plaster, with large pillars sitting in the
rooms to keep the large municipal building astand.

The Torspoon Construction Agency~
{x This is quite a sight to see, this "store" seems to be just a
house, or similar to that of one.  Where the floor is the pattern of
a Gigantic tree cut in twain, where the rings go around the entire
floor, and the walls are also made of unfinished wood with the
windowcills made of bark.  The proximity of the buildings just let in
enough light to keep this place lit.  The beds are bunk-beds, two on
each side made of entire logs and sticks cut bear and unfurnished. 
The room has a large rug on the middle of the floor and a set of
tools hanging over the walls such as saws, and a large "tool room" to
the east, and before that is a large desk for customers, and a piece
of parchment laying upon it.

The Torspoon Blacksmith~
{Here sits an odd commodity, it is a port more than a building, a
roof with one wall in the back and half walls on the sides, while
only mere posts sit on the corners of the large semi-ovular building,
holding up the straw and hay rooftop which goes into a huge peke with
a hole, allowing smoke to billow out.  The ground here is all made of
brick, which is covered with metal shavings and pieces of soot, all
comming from the two large furnace like fireplaces, glowing with red
hot coals.  Many billows and water pools and forges sit placed around
here.  On the backwall are piles of tools, aprons, chunks of iron and
premade weapons.

The Seaside Bookstore~
{x This building is rather small, only a mere twenty five by
fifteen or twenty paces large.  None of the walls are visible as
shelves surround everywall except the west wall which the creeky
wooden door is.  A few small windows sit along it, showing in the
light to keep the library lit enough.  The shelves are jam packed
full or all sorts of rare and exotic books.  In the center of the
room there is a small rug and a comfortable chair and a small table
next to it.  Along the East wall is a small desk with a feather quill
and a piece of parchment, along with a few stacks of books.

{x Here sits an open building sitting to the ocean, with a large
openable deck, with small tables and chairs.  The peaceful sound of
the ocean fills the cafe, as the smell of coffees and treats can also
fill the air.  It has an old nostalgic feeling to it, with a few
trinkets like a sand-dollar windchime, hanging from the west roof
corner, hanging over the seating area.  A small desk sits in the back
of the cafe with a large shelf full of confectionary items.

The Bait and Tackle Shop~
{x This shop is a really old and salty one, perhaps one of the
oldest shopson the block, with a small yellow building with worn
walls and an old red wood roof, that seems to be falling apart. 
Inside smells pretty salty and musty, the floorboards look alittle
grayish and worn as well.  The walls are lined up and down with
fishing rods and large wooden shelves sit up and down the floor
covered with different tackles and lures.  A large fish shaped
lantnern hangs from the ceiling of the room to keep it lit at al
times.

A small House~
{x You stand inside of a small house, with fine wooden floors and
a set of white walls, close together, some say it would be cozy
however.  A small brick fireplace sits here, which is filled with
black embers, and a small wooden table for two beside of it.  A small
kitchen area sits around, and a set of stairs which lead upstairs to
the bedrooms.  However, this house looks quite abandoned, though
there are signs of life here, it appears to have a thick layer of
dust over everything.
