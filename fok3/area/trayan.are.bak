Outside the Church~
You stand before the Grand Church of Thera.  The church is
intricately carved out of the finest marble, polished everyday buy a
group of pixies hired from the pixie forest.  Holding the entrance to
the church up is four giant marble pillars inlayed with gold and
platinum ropes.  Before the doors stand two giant gargoyles that have
volunteered to protect the church.  The doors to the church are very
tall and are made of very thick oak held together with the strongest
of all iron and the hinges are almost as big as a standard human.

Federal Bank of the Church~
As you look around the first thing to catch your eye is the size
of the banker himself.  As you look around you notice the same thing
you noticed in the General Store, pictures of the same people hanging
on the walls.  Back in one corner of the room is a desk covered with
gold and silver coins and a scrap of parchment with some numbers
writen on it.  One of the walls here looks kind of funny but it must
be nothing.

with some loud growling and a foul smell comming from it.
