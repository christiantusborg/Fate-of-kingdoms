This is the statue of The Necromancer of War.  It has fought many
battles in its past and is now owned by the King of this castle for
it to stand around looking pretty.  It is roughly 7 feet tall and is
made of some sort of stone.  Its eyes are closed and it dosent seem
to care that you enter the room.  In its right hand, it has a sharp,
flaming, very scary looking whip that he uses for War.  Not the first
statue you would try and kill...

and was of an such evil mind.  This is what's left of him, it may not
look like much, but he might still be a very dangerous person, or
thing, or maybe he has just gotten worse since the magic happening
here really screwed things up with the chamber here.  It looks like a
large black cloud of evil, with a pair of glowing red eyes, you
almost get nightmares just by looking at it, I wouldnt pick a fight

This zombie looks pretty much like any other zombie you've seen. 
Rotting, decaying flesh covers his body, grey skin and rotted muscles
hanging around.  All of his teeth are showing cuz of the lack of
chins.  His right eye is gone, all rotted away, while his left eye is
nothing but white and scary.  The legends say that Tallorhan was a
travelling paladin, on the look for evil to fight, but somehow he got
into this town and the King ordered him to be arrested immediately
for coming into this nothing but evil town so he was thrown into this
cell, doomed to eternal peril and torture.  Over the years, he has
apparently died in this cell and has risen from the dead for unknown
reasons and here he stands as an undead.  He is wearing some divine
looking legplates that glow of pureness and he is holding a shocking
lance, which he apparently used to fight evil with.

She now looks like this, a half-decayed, grey, rotten zombie with
only dirty rags as clothes.  Her eyes are white and empty and almost
all the hair on her head is gone.  Muscles are showing because of
rotted away skin.  She sits on the floor here, all empty minded.  You
can see she is wearing some shining silvery ornaments, maybe those
are the reason she was put in here..

eventually all of the people got paranoid and thought that he was
gonna be the doom of this city so they locked him away in here to let
the rats feast on him.  He has little clothes on, barely a ripped up
pair of pants.  His jaw is gone, all rotted away and his skin is
still decomposing, he is missing a ear and a eye and all of the hair
on his head is gone He doesnt carry himself in a much threatening

used to be the King's royal warrior but was put in here ages ago for
some unknown reasons.  He is quite large, maybe 6 feet tall and very
big muscles, although he is rotting so his muscles kinda hang outside
of what skin he has left.  His jaw is missing and his eyes are
totally white.  His skin is grey and almost liquid as you touch it. 
All he is wearing is an old rusty manacle hanging around his neck.

The weapon shop~
You have entered the shop of the weaponmaster.  This is the best
place for any traveller to buy fine forged weapons at fair prices.
This room looks like from something out of a viking village.  Shields
and swords and axes and whatever is hanging on the brown wooden walls
around here.  Shelves stand against the wall with weapons and such
things in them.  There are 2 windows facing the street outside, but
there are some raggedy curtains infront of them so not much light
gets in here.  There is a small fireplace in the corner heating the
room and giving it light though.  The mighty weaponmaster stands
behind the counter, brushing a sword.

The master archer's humble abode~
This is the shop of the master archer.  This room doesn't look
very nice.  The walls and floor and roof are made of wood but it
looks like it has started to decompose, most of the wood is cracked
and grey.  A lantern hangs on the wall giving a slight light to the
room, making you notice the small details.  There is a bulls'eye on
the wall with 3 arrows stuck in the middle.  A solo window next to
the door faces the eastern street to the south.  The master archer
himself stands behind the old counter, looking angry..

The Potion Shop~
This shop smells like a hospital center or a dentist.  An old man
stands here, smiling at you, hoping that you will buy some of his
potions.  The walls are white and there is only one window facing to
the western street.  The floor has chess-colored tiles and there is
alot of light in the room.  Shelfes with potions and pots and
bandages and such are lined against the wall looking very neat.  The
old man is standing behind the counter waiting for you to make a
purchase.

The Bakery~
As you enter this room, you get struck by a wave of heat and the
delicious smell of fresh-baked bread, rolls, pies, danishes, cakes
and much, much more.  This is a bright room with two windows facing
the western street.  The walls are of a bright yellow color and the
floor is covered with orange tiles.  The counter is protected by a
window and behind the window lies alot of bakery.  Plants are
standing in the corners of the room, making the room look nicer. 
There is a door to the right, probably leading into the kitchen or
wherever the baker is making all of the bakery.  A woman with a white
baker uniform covered with flour is standing behind the desk staring
at you...  She may not be as kind as she looks.

The Fat Man Restaurant~
This is the entrance to The Fat Man Restaurant.  It doesnt look
too bad but as you get closer to the waitress at the entrance, you
get some creepy vibes..  It doesn't look too good in there, the air
is all tight but it smells good though and the floor is dirty and
sticky.  But some of the food here looks awfully tempting.

are (almost) white as well.  This looks like a kitchen all right. 
There is a chef here making food, looking terribly stressed...

This is the back alley behind the restaurant.  The alley is
cramped with space and there is only a couple bags of garbage and a
garbage can with a lid here and a cat trying to look for food.  The
walls in the alley is made of red bricks and is very smelly because
of all the garbage.  You start to wonder, is this the place they
throw out their garbage, or where they get in their groceries..?

large grey building with no life at all..  There are probably
something in it but the area around it sure seems very dead and cold.

{xYou find yourself standing infront of a huge castle.
The castle is made from lots and lots of grey brick stones.
The towers of the castle stands really high, about 30 feet
high. On the top of the middle towers there are 3 red flags
with the symbol of Larinach on them. The air around here
smells like death and there is a slight breeze giving you
chills to your bones. Everything here just seems dead, exept
the two guards who are standing here.

The room of the warmage statue~
This room is dark with little light in it.  There is only one
window near the ceiling decending some light.  The room is mostly
cobblerock and is normally sized, maybe 15 by 15 foot.  This room is
meant for the statue of the warmage to be in.  The king really likes
to collect things, especially statues with weapons that are
legendary.  This is not the only room with a statue in it, be sure of
that...  Just don't spend too much time in here before the King finds
out that you are here lurking around among his valuables.

seems dead..  You can spot the town south from up here, it looks
rather small.  You can spot some people in both directions.

You are standing on the east guard tower of the castle.  It is
quite cold here with the icy wind blowing pretty hard.  Everything up
here just seems dead..  You can spot the town south from up here, it
looks rather small.  The archers who are standing here is staring
into the air with dead eyes.  This is a good spot for them to nail
potential threats though.

The Warden's office~
This is the old office of the warden.  The room is very dark but
you can barely see what the walls and floor look like.  The walls are
made of some ugly old bloodstained wood and the floor is made of
bloodstained stones.  There is a rotten desk in the center of the
room with the remains of what should be a chair on the back of it. 
Behind the desk stands a horrible looking zombie, probably the zombie
of the warden, watch out for him.

A seemingly empty cell.~
This cell is very small, maybe 5 by 5 foot and has a small drain
in the middle of the cell floor.  The floor is all messy and covered
with blood and slimy stuff.  The walls look pretty much the same,
awful.  Only a very small light hangs from the roof decending a
slight ray of light into the cell.  You can notice something's
presence in here but not exactly what.  You can feel heat coming from
somewhere and you can hear some low growling.

The Armorer~
This is the armor shop, and it's the best armor shop within miles.
Here you can buy anything from rings to shields at a fair price. 
This shop is like the other shops, made of darkened wood, making it
look like some viking hut.  There is a lantern on the wall which
provides the shop with neccecary light.  On the walls to your left
and right are shields with 2 swords across them.  Behind a wooden
counter stands Phil, the armorer which makes all sorts of armor and
has it for sale.  Behind him is a shelf with some of the items that
you can buy.

The malicious wizard's shop~
You have entered the shop of the malicious wizard.  Just as you
enter the shop you are struck by a wave of a sickly sweet smell that
makes you gag.  This shop is similar to the other shops, darkened
wood walls, ceiling and floor.  The only lightsource in this shop is
a hovering ball of fire that hovers 7 feet over the center of the
room.  This place is pretty spooky, no windows or anything just a
very dark room with that fireball and that wizard standing behind his
counter looking very evil.  Behind him stands a shelf filled with
numerous different scrolls that are for sale.

The shop is made of darkened wood logs and there is only one window
here facing the street but the curtains are closed.  The primary
lightsource here is an expensive looking chandelier hanging on the
top of the ceiling.  The stench of cigar-smoke hits you like a wave
as you enter the shop.  Behind the wooden counter stands Vinny, a
huge man who looks really solid.  Behind him are some shelves with
many different things in them, weapons, armor, you name it.  This
sure is the best place to sell things.

The Crippeled Traveller Inn~

occupied but you can buy the key to your own private room if you
like.  This Inn has a standard viking house-look, darkwood walls
and roof, a couple of torches on the wall and a window facing the
street outside.  The Innkeeper Tim stands behind the counter, or
maybe you can call it a bar, waiting for travellers to rent rooms.
