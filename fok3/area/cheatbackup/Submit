That is to say, I totally agree with the banning of
alternate characters (alts).
 
They are being abused in the cases of multi-playing, rping
pking, eq transfer and so on and so on.
 
It would save most of us a lot of time and effort if the alts
were just banned altogether.

Subject Effects of mounting on combat~
Text
I have a few ideas about mounting and its effects on
combat. Let me know what you think of these:
 
1: A mounted character can flee at any time, even when lagged.
2: " can only take hits from a maximum of 2 opponents
during a combat round.
3: " can charge more than once during combat.
4: " gets a certain % chance that any attack will strike his/her
mount rather than the target.
5: If the player obtains a mount with the flying ability, he/she
will also be able to fly and receive all bonuses granted thereof.
 
I think #5 might already exist. I'm not sure.
 
Let me know about the others. Please respond on this board with
your thoughts.

I aggree with #1 that a mounted character can flee at anytime
well almost anytime anyway, but then we get into really complex
how the combat system I devised works, but I would say
a mounted character can flee at any time unless in
combat with another mounted character.
 
#2 actually is kinda silly, I don't agree with that at all
that isn't that much of an issue tho.  You should have
a chance of not getting hti cause they hit your mount tho
 
I totally disagree with #3, you can't charge again unless you flee
and put some distance for you to charge, you can't like charge if
you right next to somebody,  that leds to a mounted attack
type called trample but thats another story.
 
#4 should most definately be implemented and same with #5, often
if someone is mounted the mount will be hit.   and if your
riding a pegasus of course you fly too. :)

I don't agree with #3, but the others look good.  ALthough, 
I also would add one that affects charge.  It seems to me
that it would make sense that a charge from horseback, so
perhaps charge should do a little extra if you are mounted.
Also, it'd be cool if a flying mob could like fly over the
mountains too.  I mean, if it's flying....  Or, perhaps just
make two, flying and soaring.  You can soar over mountains
but can't fly over them.
 
This also brings up another thing.  Any mob can walk over
water when tracking you or following you regardless of if
it has fly or not.  Also, all mobs seem to have the track
skill, while only a very few character classes get the skill.
Perhaps it should be added as an act flag that it tracks,
but it should definitely be kept so that if you go back in
the room it attacks you.

Text
Well I agree mostly with what Conrad said but also agree
when ari said you cant be charge again even on a mount.
And You should be able to do GREAT amount of damage when
you are mounted and Charge right into your enemy and GREAT
amount of lag time because you enemy had been knocked and
greatly injured by your lance charge on a mount! So that should
take time to recover up. And yes I think it's a wonderful idea
about fleeing in under any lag attacks from your enemy when
you are mounted on a ride. Because first of all you have the 
advantage on your horse or whatever you are on inorder to
flee from combat with great speed! But in any events like when
2 people are on mount and 1 of them charge the other one on the
mount and hit, then the one who's got charged should lag as on
foot and even maybe fall off from your mount? =)

Woah, woah.. Woah. Now these crazy super-powerful mounts
would be nice, but incrediable strange. If someone attacked
you and they were mounted on one of those charmed dragons 
then you could not win. I thought the problem with battle
was that it was to easy for an unsuspecting person to be
killed ( Kinda like real life ). It would be all good if
it was just horses, with like 200 hps each, But like the
Argus dragon or the Gondor dragon which you can buy would
make the mounter completely invinciable because no one could
just kill leaveing you lagable ( which is still easy to escape )
 
 I mean think about, im gonna get me a dragon, im gonna charge
you. Then the dragons going to trip you until your dead. and there
isnt a single thing you can do about except run, because if I take
to much damage, or the dragon misses a trip, then ill just flee.
 Once again, another one of those wonderful rp suggested changes
thats works so terriably and makes soemthing super powerful beyond
belief, but heck usually they allmost always get coded so I dunno
why I bother to complain.

I suggest you that fly alwasy if you do not want to be trip.
Second of all, in real life event, you would be dead if you
get charge with a lance when the lancer is mounted on a horse
or any mount that runs like a speeding arrow. So I think
mounted charges or attacks should do great damage against the
mounted or nonmounted people. Again you should be able to flee
when you are mounted and someone come attack you even with a 
shieldbash or whatever, if that attacker is not mounted.

Here is one problem everyone has overlooked so far.
Riding a mount is one thing but fighting from one is
another.  Second hitting someone on foot from a mount
can be difficult because all they have to do is wait
until the last minute before side stepping you.  If
I remember my history right this was how the Muslims
were able to win almost every conflict with the knights
(after they figured this out of course).  They waited
for the knights to charge with their heavy lances, then
side steped them so they were forced to keep moving forward
while they were behind them and they were able to take 
them out before they could turn around to do another
charge.  
-Just some thoughts on the matter

Well I don't know much history so sorry. But think logic!
lets say little kanshin is on a big black horse and hey!
little kanshin has a big bad lance in his hand and charging
right toward you! And if you get Hit what happens to you?
I don't know you tell me. Second of all, you say it is easy
to move or step aside from the charging mounted enemy... and
you say that it is easy to dodge and step aside from the mounted
enemy. Well let's see now, when someone come and attack you pk that
is, your enemy wont be saying here i come and gonna charge at you!
ready or not! =P My friends it is an element of suprise that the
best survive in pks, and no one i mean no one i knew on this mud
gives warning or any such thing like that when they are gonna pk
someone, so how the hell are you gonna dodge or step aside from
a charging mounted enemy, if you dont even know if he is coming 
after you or not? That is the point im talking about. 
 
Another thing is that in the old days, the horse calvary is the
main force in the army, foot soldiers will be crushed, slice,
chop, hack, stomp by the calvary in anyways. So I think mounted
person has great more advantage than a foot soldier.
 
ps: I'm really serious about this thing. You can't dodge or move 
   away from a suprise attack people. That is why they call it
   ummm... suprise attack! =)

The reason no one gives a warning before pk on this mufd
is that with lag attacks, the first person to get the attack
in wins, regardless.  It makes the whole subject of 'pkilling'
moot, since theres no real startegy, except always looking out
for yourself the entire time.  But even then, you can start
combat with a lag attack, so it's moot again cause once you
have someone lagged, you just have to wait till they die.
Before you start adressing issues such as moutned combat, I
think this issue needs serious consideration and revision.

You say that people beating the crap out of other people
because they're on a mount makes sense logically and
realistically.  Allow me to make a list of things that
should be changed on fate to make things more realistic
and logical:
 
 - The horse selling guy should no longer have an infinite
   supply of horses, and they should cost more than 16 silver
   each.  Realistically, horses are quite valuable.
 
 - If a mage casts lightning bolt, fireball, acid blast, firewind,
   any breath spells, etc. etc. on you, you should die.  All those
   spells could realistically drop anyone in one hit.
 
 - If someone walks up and hits you in the head with their axe, you
   should die.  If you're incredibly lucky, you'll live long enough
   to flop around on the ground until they hit you with it again.
 
 - Realistically, no matter how skilled you are at charging someone,
   people will still sometimes be able to step out of the way.
 
The list goes on.  If we want to be realistic, all characters,
regardless of class and race, shouldn't have more than 10 hp for
a human, 20 for an ogre by level 81.
 
If we were trying to be realistic here, the only thing people could do
would be run around in sub issue eq and hit people with their weapons,
because that's the only thing that works in real life.

Basically my point is that a player on a mount can easily
create some distance between himself and someone on foot.
Think of it this way.
 
If I am fighting with you, and I am mounted, and you are
on foot, what is stopping me from running off, turning around,
and charging? Probably what I am talking about would already
be implemented if my #1 suggestion goes in, though. Its 
more or less the same. The only difference there is that
the unmounted player has a chance to stop the charge by
running into the room and initiating combat first, which
is somewhat unrealistic.

Subject Mount Balancing~
Text
I understand the interest in being sure that mounts dont
become the be-all and end-all of pk, but right now, lag
attacks are quite dominating and ridiculous. This might
be one way to make them less valuable.  Obviously, you
cant trip/throw someone from their horse, although it
would be interesting to see some code added to bash that
would allow it to knock a person off their horse.
 
Anyway, the best way to balance mounts if these suggestions
are implemented is to (A) limit their supply and (B) fix
the shopkeepers to charge exorbitant prices for them. I'd
say 300 gold for a level 20 mount is reasonable. Anyway,
I dont see many people using mounts for anything but explor-
ation, when it seems to me like even a black-knight or
paladin with a longsword on a mount is much better than
one without.
 
It wouldnt even be necessary to use a lance. Most calvalry
units didnt use them, anyway. They were more for show and
chivalry because they looked cool. An intelligent warrior
would stick with sword and shield on his horse.

said this game isn't about realistism its a game, and it needs

I got both charge and riding, but thats not gonna stop me
from suggesting to keep this new mount idea a little reasonable
so it doesnt become an overpowerfull thing.
In the same time I like more tricks and strategys imped in
PK, so Im gonna try make a list of things this idea would need
to be really cool and not too wild.
 
1. Yes, getting charged by a mounted person should do considerable
damage and lag quite alot...BUT
 
2. code a timer for charge so ppl cant flee and recharge target to
get same effect as Ambush had in the past while lagging ppl constantly
untill they die.
 
3. Make it impossible to dodge while mounted(if thats not already in)
 
4. Develop a formular based on riding skill to determine ppl's chance of
avoiding a lag attack and fleeing while mounted(make chance small)
 
5. Code it so people charging someone wielding a Polearm, footmans lance
or spear risk getting countered(even if target doesnt have counter)
By this I meen code it so theres a risk the mounted charger impales
himself on the targets weap if its one of the weaps mentioned before.
 
6. code it so for every round of battle a mounted player must pass some
sort of riding-check roll based on riding % or fall off the horse cuz

7. Ohh..yeah..I know Im going ballistic with realism here, but I think

should mounted charge be revamped. Also put a little downside to it to

WTF is wrong with you people? When I said about thie mount
charge, I meant only add more damage in first CHARGE on a 
mount, not the follow up regular attacks! And I'm not trying
to be so realistic. Dont have to be. I agree just these...
 
1 - Adds Good Damage to Charge on a mount.
2 - Mounted person can flee under any lag attacks. Except the
    lag attack on the other mount.
 
That's all I've been trying to tell you.

Well I just thought about it. What Scone said is very true.
In his note #62, he said if you are on a mount and charge at
someone on foot or on mount, it should lag but if the other
guy throw you back useing throw skill, then I think you shouldnt
be able to flee. I think mounted person can be only lag under
throw attack and should be able to flee under trip shieldbash,
. Again Mounted person can be only lag and not able to flee
under other charges, throw.

I think the whole Idea of a footsoldier using a Lance
to charge someone is gay, and doing it repeatedly is even
more gay.  Now, I think charge should only be allowed with
mounted units/persons, and make it so you can only charge
once every three rounds, and increase charge damage.
 
  but....I also think there should be a decent chance of 
dodging someone charging you, like 30-40%.  That's about
as realistic as you can get without going overboard.
And if you think that's gay, try being an Ogre that can't hit,
dodge, or generally function in any reasonable manner.
 
 
  Oh, and and I think you should also be able to chagre
with spears too....charge rather....

I dunno kanshin, one of your notes said that lag should
still affect you if your thrown, but if I trip your horse..
then why can you flee? And if I bash you with a shield
and "you go down" like it says in the shield bash message
then wouldn't you kinda fall off your horse?
 
 Or what if I bash you, now no one really knows what bash
does because the explaination of it is that you slam into
whoever and they go down, but the main point is there.
 
 All of these lag attacks seem to me like in a "realistic"
setting they would either knock you off your horse, but id like
to see anyone let me bash them with a shield and then ride away
right in the middle of our battle, aftergoing down.. Whatever that means
 
 But like the one guy said, if this mud were realistic then
we'd have a whole new problem so were left with what..?
 
 Yes mounts currently are unrealistic.. Because they dont help
you ride away quickily from battle.
 
 But no they shouldnt make you unlagable because all of these
lags attacks descriptions seem like things that would affect a
mounted rider.
 
 I like what Azazel is saying but only for the part where he says
lets not get outta control making mounts to strong, and I like what
Imrahil said dont try and get speck out of your eye when theres a

Azazel has some good ideas. None of these things, I'd
guess (although Kazmir is obviously the authority on
this) would be difficult to code.
 
I never inteded to suggest these things beacuse they are
realistic. They are, but thats not my point. I think
balancing mounts would improve gameplay. Currently they
are only used for exploration. Mounts would give lag-
attack happy classes another thing to think about, and
create a new school of fighting based on mounts. These
ideas would not only be useful in PK but against mobs
as well.
 
As far as realism-phobia goes, I am not impressed by it.
Its okay to be realistic, guys. This is a fantasy mud,
not a limbo mud with no laws of physics.
 
On to specific things:
 
1: Its impossible for a person on foot to trip a horse.
A horse has four legs. It just isnt going to happen. MAYBE
if you were a very big ogre or giant you could run and
shield bash
 the horse and knock it over.
 
2: Personally I dont envision charge as being limited to
lances. A person with a sword could get a running start
and put some extra momentum into his swing, too. But 
thats more of a side-note; I dont want to open THAT can
of worms :P
 
3: Most, if not all, mounts should NOT fight during combat
and should not penalize the player on XP. Most people
ride their mounts until they find the area and then kill/
nofol the mount beacuse it takes up experience. That should
not happen.

Here is lots of good, i like them on i will
just be nice and tell you how i pland it to be am still

1. If you mounted it make 2* dam and lag
2. You can't charge in the fight.
3. When you mount is killed while not it lag you badly
4. You can't parry werry well.
5. You get better AC.
errrrr not parry in 4 but dodge
 
RE'S
Fleeing while fightint, i don't think it will be easy when
you have to make the horse flee as well not just you self
 
With you ideas here is how i think it will be good to
code it.
 
1.Getting charged by a mounted person should do considerable
damage and lag quite alot.
 
2. You can't recharge while fighting
 
3.3. Make it impossible to dodge while mounted
 
4. Develop a formular based on riding skill to determine ppl's chance of
avoiding a lag attack and fleeing while mounted(make chance small)
 
6. code it so for every round of battle a mounted player must pass some
sort of riding-check roll based on riding % or fall off the horse cuz
he cant control it in the frey.
 
7. Better AC when mounted. (Harder to hit)
 
8. If mound killed the player will get some lag when fall off
 
9. If you miss you target with you charge, the will be a change of you
 throwen of the mount and you will be laged and hurt

As far as what Kazmir said about it being hard to flee comba
while mounted....I would think it would be easier.  You just
make your mount shoot forward.  Boom, you're gone.  I also
agree with Conrad that it would be impossible to trip a mount
and, even if you managed to do it, because of the physics
involved, the horse would probably fall ON you, causing quite
a bit of damage cause, well, let's just say horses aren't
bunnies when it comes to landing on you....   As far as doing
double damage while mounted, i'd say no.  Perhaps a slight
increase in damage, yes, but I think the biggest benefit to
being mounted would be that you would have an easier time hitting
someone b/c you are higher up than they are.  As for lances,
unless you make a distinction between a footmans lance and a
lance lance, I don't see how you could use the lance any other
way except mounted.  Unless, of course, you are an exceptionally
large race, but even then it would be difficult to wield.  IE -
the lances should be useable from horseback only.
 
And, to add on to what Conrad said about not getting penalized
for having a mount.  The same goes in general for any charmie
or pet.  For one, if they get the kill, you get 0 xp, which is
needless to say, stupid.  Now, this shouldnt be taken out of
proportion either, cause if you are using a mob to do all the
damage and take all the damage, you shouldn't get much xp cause
you didnt do anything in the battle.  But as far as horses go,
I don't think yo ushould get the grouped rate of xp, but it als
shouldn't count against you.  Another thing, perhaps we need to
secify between warhorses and a regular horse.  A warhorse can be
just as deadly in combat as the swordsman on his back.  Also,
the rider would be a lot less likely to fall off.  Wheras at the
smell of blood a normal horse would get jittery and wanna run,
not to mention when swords start swinging around it.  Perhaps make
a new flag - mount, and war-mount to specify between those who are
trained for combazt and those who arent.

There is a big difference between insane and extremist.
If a person were to use the 'extremist' rp to kill anyone,
saying "He said something I didnt like so I killed him"
then that would be wrong, but Tyrin's extremist rp seems
much more logical and reasonable; he at least appears
to be following a pattern. If he doesnt like something
Mordukhan is doing, he might believe it is his holy right
to kill them until they stop doing it.
 
I know what you're probably thinking. "Ok, I'll start
doing it too."  In this case I think it wouldnt be a bad
idea if it were Fate policy that it is illegal to be a
dumbass. If everyone starts doing this then of course the
mud will degenerate, but to have a few people doing it
is not wholly bad or even unreasonable. When you think about
it, 90% of the people here are totally normal and rational
people. Those who roleplay as idiots, lunatics, or extrem-

Tyrins RP is a perfect fit for the inquisitor class, and as

wished to have performed. He should NOT have taken his now

Assassin to kill someone out of the blue.
1. Being fanatically good usually meens not allying with Evil.

3. Being insane is not portrayed well when the "insane" person

etc. So WHAT would make this nice little elf cleric to become an

I will now quote some part out of Tyrin's and Elecial's PK notes.
 
"Hiring an elite friend of mine, who also holds no love for those

foul-smelling louts? Did you know that drows are actually kinda clean?

"Knowing Aztaroth's sick perversions, I knew he would like seeing an

had for the boy."
Excuse me Elecial, WHAT the f*ck are you talking about? I haven't ever

 I will make it clear for everyone once and for all, Mordukhan is _not_

odd how an elf can RP evil at all.. As Imrahil pointed out on OOC
yesterday, in the elf help file, it states very clearly, that elves are
NOT evil, they are very rarely neutral.. It's virtually impossible for

an inquisitor, but using the cleric for evil.  Tyrin
is easily one of the olest players ON FATE 3!  He has

to something like that.
 
As for Elecial talking aobut your 'sick perversions', see
the above pargraph.  Drow have been strereotyped as
heartless killers, and  that's not gonna go away.
 
Though I can't explain him hiring elecial, i can see
easily how he could justify whaking out like this and,
seeing a drow, the archenemy of the elven race, he would
do whatever possible to eliminate them

Subject RPING GOOD EVIL~

Ummm, just a point I'd like to make, I do believe Satan
For all you Satanics out there, was Highest Ranking Angel
of Heaven before he got jealous of o'l White Beard(God)
and was cast outta heaven.....
 
 
  My point is, even the ultimate good guys have their faults.
And anyone can percieve goodness in different aspects.
It doesn't have to make sense(Satan had it pretty good I think)
or follow a predicatble course.  Good guys think they are right,
most bad guys think they are right also.  At least Evil is
usually predictable, it's the good guys you gotta watch out for,
ya never know when they might get tired of being a knight in 
shining armor and start going ape shit.
 At any rate, to me, Roleplaying can take infinitely various
forms, and therefore people should be able to rp any way they
choose, so long as they stick to it, follow through and
follow the guidelines of a Fantasy MUD.........
 
  Ummmm, not sure if I hit on any points here, just fealt
like rambling.....

Sure it should be OK for good aligned ppl to go nuts and
fanatic, what Im missing is a satisfactory amount of RP
to explain such a vital change in behavior. If you want
to go nuts, then at least try to uphold a certain standard
og insanity, instead of just writing one note and the take
quick and cheap advantage of your sudden new Fanatic, evil
or insane state by PK'ing someone.
Without wanting to judge Tyrins RP in any other way than saying
theres not enough of it, all I want to add is that when you dont
RP more, your insanity very much gets the fishy smell of PK-lust
build on a foundation of quickly thought up, not thoroughly
introduced RP....

Subject INSANITY For RP PKING~
Text
On this you have a point, pks are divided into three
categories from what I can tell.
 
1. Kingdom War Pks
2. Greed Pks
3. Insanity pks for those who just wanna pk....
 
 
 And there ya have it, not making any accusations
but that's my take on things.....Which is why I changed
my Rp to being a plain old bully.....gett'n to be that
everyone on this mud is insane, one way or another...

Text
If you wanna rp something do it constantly. Not only on
notes and not only once per week on gossip.
 
 But no ones gonna do that because its hard when no one
else does. So those of you who love your rp do something
other then complaining. Set an example by constantly rp'ing
and maybe something will change. But notes on submit arn't
going to get anything done.

Text
hi
i dont want to maon, and if this is moaning im sorry
but
pking is supposed to be regulated on here, 
having read his nore on killing me
he did it cos "he hadnt tasted elf brain before"
is that really sufficient justification for pking?
if he had told me that i would have given him directions to elvendar
and wished him luck
i wont deny im pissed at loosing some equipment, but what really gets
to me is the reason he killed me
i enjoy this mud, and this doesnt change it, but if a player can pk cos
they havent tasted that particular flavour of brain before
it really makes a mockery of the idea of regulated pk
like i said, i dont want to moan (lol) 
so if you say what was done was cool, then fair enough
but how long before people are pking cos "i never tasted someone
called bob before"?

Some of you guys never cease to amaze me. I think what I'm
going to have to do from now on is note Mordukhan and make
sure they are completely aware of everything I'm going to
do before I do it. I'm really gonna have to spell it out 
for Aztaroth since he can't even realize that 'foul-smelling
louts' wasn't supposed to be taken literally. 
 
As for my rp, I'm gonna stick to it and those of you who don't
like it can basically just suck it. Conrad says it's ok and
agrees that we need some rp on here and none of the other imms
seem to be overly bothered by it. Personally I think your all
just pissed cause we roasted and toasted Aztaroth eh? 
 
Why don't you all try and rp back instead of crying? If one of
my kingdom members was killed wouldn't it make sense to go after
the killer? Heh. Guess not. Better whine to the imms instead.

Great to finally have you RP Tyrin, its the only really
cool aspect of all this. Its almost like a gay finally
stepping out of the closet having you RP for the very
first time on fate 2 and 3.
If you want, I can prolly give you some tips on how to
get a little depth in the RP, so it doesnt smell as fishy
when you pk people based on it. Just let me know, and I'll
try help you.

Just so you know, Myurikk, when I am on and I have time
(meaning more than 15-30 mins) I can almost always be
found at the fountain, in character, talking to friends
and foes alike.  Discussing philosophies, how I view life
vs how Drow do, stuff like that.  I have hours upon hours
of logs from the past 2 weeks alone.  Some of do actually
rolepaly, so why don't you seek us out, and try to get
involved, rather than telling us we don't do it enough.

still don't got any channels and can't tell people with
vorph, not sure if i still can't write notes either..
now, let's get to business..
 
1. I want Conrad FIRED for alt-revealing on a public board.
 
2. I was actually RPing this serious, I was constantly IC
with Vorphalack, I ran around eating brains instead of normal
food.. Also, I've heard that Tyrin's madness reason was cuz
he was going to make some bs kingdom with Elecial, and I have
as well been working on a kingdom with Vorphalack. 
 
3. I thought this was decent RP nowadays, and imo, this was
definately the most fun RP i've done on fate.. Now as I'm
slayed, I guess i'll just walking around RPing with Vorphalack
until his RP is accepted. If you balefire him, I guess I'll
do some new character with weird and original RP.
 
and Azazel, you should've accepted that bet :> You would've won
a beer, cuz Vorphalack was slayed around 30 hours after I proposed
the bet.. too bad for you :>
