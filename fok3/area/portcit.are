Cavapatti The Traveler~
A Traveling Priest stands here, proclaiming his poems.
~
{x A tall man from a far away land stands here, a thin figure
wearing odd garments from a distant land.  With long and cute curly
golden blonde hair, with a tall studded white and black hat on his
head, much like a cylander.  His robe matchs his hat, a black and
white robe with red spikes and stripes on the hemp like material.  As
a wanderer he also wears a set of heavy leather and brass armor
across his chest, with a set of scroll and book holders along his
back.  Along his slender legs are a pair of black clean pants,
similar to a bellbottom quality, and a pair of worn black shoes are
tightly wrapped around his well traveled feet.  Most would see him as
very charismatic, with his very gentle large brown eyes and a warm
smile on his cutely round face.

Salty the Bar-tender~
An Old one-eyed man stands behind the bar, serving drinks.

{x An estranged old man, obviously the owner of the bar, is most
likely in his late fifty's perhaps, and still holding strong.  He is
rather skinny, but muscular and built despite his age.  His hair has
turned a full fledged grey and balding as most of the hair on the top
of his head has already fallen out, since then his hair frows out
wildly.  His face filled with wrinkles and his left eye has a big
black patch over it.  His jaw and chin tucks under as he lost most of
his teeth from scurvy.  He is dressed slightly better than a sailor,
in a stained white shirt with an apron and a pair of tattern blue
pants.

medium tone despite her sunny disposition.  Her appearance is rather
attractive, as she shows it by wearing a fine form fitting dress of
well..  Blue!  That covers her body and a brilliant orange and purple
sarong that sashes across her torso.  She wears sandals on her feet,
showing her casualness around her bar of new and exotic antiquities.

strange yellow robe, long and drapes to the ground and a white neck
cover that drapes down to his waist.  As strange as his appearanace
and smell, he is rather kind and sounds gentle, always willing to
trade his books for rare ones or foreign ones.

always finds its way upon.  He seems to be in his late fifties

days, as the creek and crack with artheritis, but he does not seem to
mind.  Old Pablo wears a simple white and red striped shirt with a
red bandana around his neck and a berret like cap on his balding gray
head.

A ghastly pirate captain stands at the helm of the ship.

monster than man.  He stands a tall six or seven paces tall, and a
wide full figured muscular being.  His body is but a mere corpse now,
with his face nothing but a skeleton but a beard of white and black
scragly hair is attatched to that jawline.  A giant curled moustache
sits above his wicked yellow grin.  Ontop of his head he wears a
pirate's tri-horn hat, marked with the insignia of his ship similar
to that of a jolly-roger.  He wears a dark blue jacket with patches
of red and dried blood, though most of his skin has melted away and
he has many bones with chunks of rotting green flesh still attatched
to them.  His clothes are very fancy though, that of a true pirate
captain.

poke through whatever left of his torso is, with a pair of black
pants and a belt straped to his abdomen.  His body was tattoo'd but
it is nothing much left after his body wasted away, he wore a white
shirt on his shoulders, but now is left is nothing but tattered cloth
wrapped around his shoulders.  His head is covered with sharp long
spikey looking hair, poking around a few feet, of ugly greenish blue
dark hair.

Marina Street Board Walk~
{x The long planks of the boardwalk are most even and flat,
sitting ontop of that grassy sand, with knot filled oak wood, still
smooth but begining to splinter at the end from age.  To the North is
a well cared for Deck, with a few large tables to sit at, well
furnished, moreso than the boardwalk.  The smell of exotic 'coffee'
comes from the building, it must be old pablo's.

to the center of town.  A massive set of buildings set on either side
up the Lazerette street, while still on the boardwalk are a line of
buildings next to the golden sands of the beach.

made of a twelve or more pace wide set of hard oak planks, They are
begining to show their age under the wear and tear of the weather and
salty air.  To the North of these well traught steps seems to be an
awkward building, where the whole wall is open with a short draping
curtain overhead as it seems to be some sort of bar to the North.

one most north of here is a massive two story building with the sign
which says Windage, above the grand double doors.

stretches like a long avenue, The sound of the peaceful waves brush
up diligently against the golden sandy beaches to the South, the sun
which may glint upon the clean sea during the day, and the moon
during the night.  However, the main attraction right now is the
massive building to the North, where a two story building, of
colossol size, sits before you, filling the area with an aroma of
delicious food.

building of a hay thatch roof cottage, hanging over the land with a
few yellow boulders blocking off the planes behind it.  Though the
street ends, there are steps to the west, only a mere two or three
steps that leads down to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.

from all shapes and sizes.  The road along here is made of a hearty
gray brick, the size of giant potatoes which are well formed together
cover the land to make a sturdy sidewalk and a road.  To the West can
be seen the sea, hanging past the giant set of docks at the wharf. 
To the Direct east from here is an old wooden shack of a building,
with large windows with compasses and anchors and more nautical
supplies hanging in it.

Port Street~
{x The smell of salty seawater was in the air, but now it just
wreaks!  The smell of fish is dominate here, maybe it was because of
the fishmarket that sits here along the gray stone path.  The
building is half open, and seems to be closeable, nothing more than a
booth with large cases full of fish sitting on icy cold waters and
platters sit here, even large barrells sit out near the street filled
with fresh live fish.  Large canopies sit overhead while in
operation, inviting people to step closer to the open fish market.

Port and Harbor Crossing~
{x A giant T of roads, where the two giant brick stone walkways
intersect, Leaving from a large wall of buildings along the east to a
large boardwalk and the sea out to the west.  The perpendicular road
links the Port and Harbor street, both equally wide roads with
sidewalks on the side.  The buildings are of all shapes and sizes,
all salty looking white plaster building with hay and straw roofs or
worn bark wood roofs with chimneys and smokestacks.

potatoe sized bricks which are inset to the ground, suspended a few
paces above the actual ground to keep it level.  Moving to the West
seems to be a few steps which leads to a giant boardwalk of
perpendicular wooden planks, with docks stretching far out to the sea
with many boats parked in there.

{x The Scene to the Left is beautiful, past thestone walkway that
you presently stand upon, goes onto the harbor which beyond that is
the sea which goes on endlessly into the horizon.  The sunsets in
that direction, with the shadows of the sails of the boats dancing
every evening.  Along this long stretching stone street are a line of
salty old buildings, slightly eroded from the sea-air, and here to
the right is one of the saltiest buildings, an old cottage looking
building with the wooden sign labled "The Grand Mariner" hangs above
the wooden door, people appear to be in it at all times, though it is
dark and scruffy looking.

grassy area, at least five or six paces above the ground as it
quickly stretches out westard to the sea and the boardwalk with the
old docks.  A small handrail is the only thing blocking off the docks
to the west which stretchs north to south with only a few entry
points.  To the East, one of the main buildings is an old shop, with
white walls with wooden frames, and a wooden sign that hangs overhead
that reads Bait and Tackle.

found everywhere.  Along the West is the wharf, which a small
handrail keeps people from jumping down there, although a few steps
is all it takes.  To the East here are aligned many many buildings,
the one here seems to be a tall roofless building, with large books
set up into the tiny windows here, labled right next to the wooden
door inside.

{x Here is either the beginning or the ending of an obscenely long
road, nearly the size of the entire city would be the wharf to the
West, where a few steps down leads you to a series of planks which
form together , floating over the water many steps to form docks. 
While to the North here, is a stone walkway which leads through the
town, with many white and wood buildings line up along the East, many
canopies and signs sit there to show that there are many shops. 
However, there is a section of toad headed to the East for a small
roadway, and to the South can barely be seen a beach.

like a small road, that is well lit, however all the white and straw
roofed cottages and buildings seem to be tightly packed together
leaving only a few feet for mud and grass to grow in between.  A few
garbage cans settle here, settled ontop of the gray brick sidewalk
and street, nestled up against those buildings.

{x Strange, the road hits a hard stop here, where the tightly
packed straw roofed houses go from east to south, meeting at a
corner.  The road here is made of a fine lumpy gray stone which
create a sidewalk and a road to walk upon.  Inbetween the crampt
buildings are small patches of grass and an occassional tree, as
everything else is covered with bricks and stones.

much further than six paces, but it seems almost like a tiny
alleyway.  With a wide road of bricks well fitted together, gray
stones making a fine sidewalk and road, while to the south turns into
a perpendicular road of hardwood planks for a boardwalk.  Many
buildings sit aligned to the street, cutting corners and looking
rather crowded.

tightly wraveled together here.  The marina to the south, stretching
from east to south has quite the wide walk-way, as now you stand on
Lazarette street, a main road which travels up hill to the North. 
Large residential buildings, though skinny, are quite tall, towering
over the gray brick street, clothes lines and flower pots hanging
from the second floor windows.

quite large, enough for a large wagon to even fit on.  The dock
stands at least six paces above sealevel, with thick logs that go
under of who knows how deep into the dark blue, the sides of the logs
covered with green moss and barnicals.  At the end of this Dock,
there are a handrail, which gaurds it, looking out to the sunset.

not a completely tropical one.  The sands are a gold color, not as
pleasent as the white sands but they are warm and clean none-the
less.  The waters here are also exceptional, clean blue waters that
are almost clear, with no dead fish or wads of seaweed in the salty
waters to the south.

and clean as the sands to the south beaches but nor does the sand
burn the feet.  The sand is clear from any obstruction of bush or
weeds, making the clean blue waters want to greet the warm sandy
beach even the more.  A large strange type of tree grows here, and
along the entire beach it seems to be the only one of its kind.  It
is a tall tree, with strange light tan barn, and the only leaves that
grow on it are the top palm like leaves, with little brown balls
growing by them.

The Beach~
{x Not a single blade of grass grows here, as the beaches are made
of clean yellow sand, which is kept level other than a few feetprint
of people admiring the beach barefoot, As long as the waves do not
wash up, they remain as little five toed stamps into the warm sands.

The Beach~
{x This certainly is NOT a tropical paradise, however it is the
best beach in west Thera, as the yellow sands are rather coarse,
moreso than the white grain beaches, but the waters are cool and
inviting.  It lacks the dead sealife which usually washes ashore.  To
the North, the boardwalk can be seen, with the line of small cottage
like buildings sitting in a row.

forgotten on these warm sandy beaches, the sounds of seagulls in the
air with the gentle splashing of the water against the clean yellow
beaches.

straw-roof cottages, thin in size but quite quaint.  Here is hte area
of a large clearing with a small fountain and flowergarden to attract
people to this center square.  Unlike most squares, this one lacks a
fountain, but rather has a massive marble statue which stands errect
in the center of the square, the size of a regular human, only on a 2

The Grand Mariner~
What a joint, the entire building had that old rusty and worn look
to it, as is the entire building, the walls were made of old salty
planks of wood, half erroded from age.  All the tables were round and
nearly a dozen of them set all around that leads to a large wooden
bar in the back.  It appeared to be a larger place than it looked
from outside, with almost a full bar full of salty sailors and
patrons who give the bar life.  Hanging on those rusty walls are
sailor's memorabelia, pictures of boats, old bouyies, and stuffed
fish hanging here and there.  Along the West wall are two windows
along side the one wooden door with a bell attatched, ringing every
time a customer enters.  Other than the three windows only tiny
candles sitting on the tables and a tiny chandelier light this entire
building during the day.

{x Slowly going further back to the bar, past the old wooden
tables, nothing in this bar seemed excessively fancy as all objects
in the bar were made of old creeky wood, the tables, chairs, walls
and even floor - making a loud creek as people step on it.  The smell
is somewhat salty and has a strong odor of a dark rum that levitates
over the bar where the tender stands with awide array of barrels and
bottles of alcohal.  It is a "lively" place as there are many patrons
sitting around but none of the patrons were by any means lively, all
of the patrons sitting and grunting veteran sailors, drinking their
precious grog as you pass.

only a tiny twenty something paces, but a two step tall curtain hangs
down from the short doorway.  But once stepping in it is like an
entirely new enviornment, with only two or three short wooden
organically shaped tables and small blue pillows to sit upon, and a
long short bar sits along the North wall with pillows on the ground
to sit upon.  Everything along the backwall sits on large shelves,
many colorful elixers and foreign beverages from the newest and most
exotic countries.  The Place is well lit and fresh air blows through,
colorful arrays dance around as candles sit in their rainbow
stainglass candleholders.

stay here.  The area seems to be two stories as the ceiling is as
taller than a giant, with a large chandalier hanging from the

front is a small wooden podium where the waiter stands waiting to

Leaving The City~
{x Going past the little Fence, rocks sit to the North, blocking
off any trail to the city, and the lead to the East with a small dirt
trail which winds through the forested area.  Very little sits around
other than a patch of wild flowers or a boring mound of dirt here and
there.  Though the fresh air blows through the wild flowers, giving a
peaceful aroma to the sections here.

needs to be swept.  The set of latters begin right past that hard
wooden door, protruding out of the wall and spiraling upwards through

{x This is quite a sight to see, this "store" seems to be just a
house, or similar to that of one.  Where the floor is the pattern of
a Gigantic tree cut in twain, where the rings go around the entire
floor, and the walls are also made of unfinished wood with the
windowcills made of bark.  The proximity of the buildings just let in
enough light to keep this place lit.  The beds are bunk-beds, two on
each side made of entire logs and sticks cut bear and unfurnished. 
The room has a large rug on the middle of the floor and a set of
tools hanging over the walls such as saws, and a large "tool room" to
the east, and before that is a large desk for customers, and a piece
of parchment laying upon it.

The Torspoon Blacksmith~
{Here sits an odd commodity, it is a port more than a building, a
roof with one wall in the back and half walls on the sides, while
only mere posts sit on the corners of the large semi-ovular building,
holding up the straw and hay rooftop which goes into a huge peke with
a hole, allowing smoke to billow out.  The ground here is all made of
brick, which is covered with metal shavings and pieces of soot, all
comming from the two large furnace like fireplaces, glowing with red
hot coals.  Many billows and water pools and forges sit placed around
here.  On the backwall are piles of tools, aprons, chunks of iron and
premade weapons.

{x This building is rather small, only a mere twenty five by
fifteen or twenty paces large.  None of the walls are visible as
shelves surround everywall except the west wall which the creeky
wooden door is.  A few small windows sit along it, showing in the
light to keep the library lit enough.  The shelves are jam packed
full or all sorts of rare and exotic books.  In the center of the
room there is a small rug and a comfortable chair and a small table
next to it.  Along the East wall is a small desk with a feather quill
and a piece of parchment, along with a few stacks of books.

large doublesided doors, with large windows inlaid to them, along
with the south wall, shinning in light to the large building.  A
large vault sits along the North wall, along with a large desk which
encompasses entire side of the Bank, enough spots for tellers to sit
behind the canopy overhead as well.

openable deck, with small tables and chairs.  The peaceful sound of
the ocean fills the cafe, as the smell of coffees and treats can also
fill the air.  It has an old nostalgic feeling to it, with a few
trinkets like a sand-dollar windchime, hanging from the west roof
corner, hanging over the seating area.  A small desk sits in the back
of the cafe with a large shelf full of confectionary items.

oldest shopson the block, with a small yellow building with worn
walls and an old red wood roof, that seems to be falling apart. 
Inside smells pretty salty and musty, the floorboards look alittle
grayish and worn as well.  The walls are lined up and down with
fishing rods and large wooden shelves sit up and down the floor
covered with different tackles and lures.  A large fish shaped
lantnern hangs from the ceiling of the room to keep it lit at al
times.

Infront of a Sunken Ship~

old sea-hag, where the wood has been worn and the sides of the ship
are filled with patches and holes.  It seems to be partially wedged
upagainst a small rock here, which you stand upon.  The entire ship
is almost capsized if not for the small chunks of dirt poking up from
the water, tipped over to convience your side, allowing a small jump
to get up to the deck of the ship.

upon the sides of the ship waaay down at the sealevel, which rocks
and mounds sit, which the ship seems to be wedged against.  With as
many holes as the sides of the ship holds, perhaps those rocks down
below are the only things keeping it afloat.

a battle here with spots of blood and broken chunks of metal stuck

huge ship of massive proportions.  The deck is now begining to rot
and the boards and planks are suffering from sea-rot.  Small holes
and cracks lay in the floorboards, so it would be wise to watch ones
step, especially with the slant the boat is currently on to the the
south, where a quarry of rocks sit.

it, mostly along the south wall as now the ship has tipped.  A small

destroyed telescope and the riches and treasures which the Captain

cramped and the water pressure makes ears pop.  The water here is ice
cold, and up to the chest, making movement very difficult, along with
the tipped floor, and objects floating in the water, also flowing in
and out of those rusted iron bar doors on either side of the ships
hallway.

The Bowels of the Ship~
{x Here is the bottom of the ship, where the water is now to the
chest, feeling freezing cold and murky blue.  The hallways are rather
dark as only a single lantern sits above head, swinging and swaying
as the capsized ship rocks with the waves and the wind.  On either
side of the hallway, instead of those wooden doors are barred doors,
with cross-hatched iron bars, to keep whoever in, in for good.

The Bowels of the Ship~
{x here is a wreched part of a ship, the lights have all burnt
out, and the hallways are getting thinner and colder as the water now
reaches up to above nipple height.  The water leaks inside from the
broken walls, but there is still air remaining, causing intense
pressure in the bowels of the ships.

A small House~
{x You stand inside of a small house, with fine wooden floors and
a set of white walls, close together, some say it would be cozy
however.  A small brick fireplace sits here, which is filled with
black embers, and a small wooden table for two beside of it.  A small
kitchen area sits around, and a set of stairs which lead upstairs to
the bedrooms.  However, this house looks quite abandoned, though
there are signs of life here, it appears to have a thick layer of
dust over everything.

The Pirates Quarters~
{x Here is a tiny room, rather large in size, however there is
only a small section of walkway, as the rest of the area are filled
up with tri-bunk beds, only leaving 3 foot clearanace between each
bed.  And a small footlocker sits at each pirate's bed, which smell
soggy and disgusting, now tipped to the side, all the belongings are
floating along the ankle high waters.

The Canoneer room~
{x Here is a long stretching room, only fifteen foot wide, but at
least half of the ship length wide.  A line of strange metal tubes
sit at what look to be windows that have been seale, with alittle
water still leaking through them.  Large iron balls sit around piled
underneath the mid shin height water, rusting away on the soggy floor
of the deck.

The Bilging Quarters~
{x Strange devices sit all over the long room here, from a lost
technology using strange metal pipes.  They tubes or pipes run all
across the room through the floor going up and down, while being
attatched to some strange poles sticking out of the ground with some
handles, giving the ability to pump the water out of the ship, but
apparently it has not been used for quite some time, as the water is
now thigh high.

The Carpentry Supply~
{x Here is the carpentry section of the ship, where boards of
woods , lengths of oak and such sit around everywhere, floating in
the high waters, growing colder and more with the pressure as the
deeper the ship goes.  Nails sit all over the floor of the ship,
somewhat missing some supplies and tools as the ship looks like
people attempted to repair the ship at one point.

The Lockhearts Kitchen~
{x Here is what were the remains of the kitchen, pots and pans
float around the murkey water which is now about thigh deep and
growing colder.  The water bubbles slightly and the pressure grows
greater as the ship grows deeper and deeper.  It is amazing that
there is still air in this part of the ship, as large wooden cabinets
are tipped over and food has been scattered, rotting in the
seawaters.

The Plunder~
{x The plunder which was filled with giant wooden chests, seems to
be entirely tipped, all the incredibly heavy chests and sacks are all
smushed together and half rotting, a few bags of gold having spilled
out and all over the floor of the waist high waters.  The waters are
incredibly col, starting to look murkier in the rotting moldy shop.

The Supply~
{x The term, Shipwreck, does apply here, as the entire pantry of
food and other supplies for the pirates, lay ablunder floating all
over the place in the waist high waters, Though the water was clear
it was dark and almost murky looking, completely filled with clothes
and rotted food chunks.  The floor which is on a slant is covered
with old rusted weapons, obstructing some walking.

The Prison of the Ship~
Here is a tiny prison chamber of the lockheart, which isn't too
much larger than an ordinary pirate's quarters.  A few sets of wet
soggy beds made of crates and blankets sit here, with a few rusted
chains laying around, old shackles which have been worn by time.  A
large metal door is to the north, also rusted by the chest high murky
salt-waters, which have made their way into the ship.

The Hold of the Ship~
{x Here is a discusting little cell, made of wood, the walls are
leaking and now the water is at least nipple high, growing colder and
the pressure becomes great, almost to deafen you.  Here is a small
set of iron bars to keep whoever in here, intact,.  Only a small
crate with a blanket sits here floating in the water, which acted as
a bed, wedged up against the west wall.

The Crows Nest~
{x Here is the lookouts chamber, ontop of a long mast with a small
latdder which climbs up the rotting pole.  There is a large bucket
maybe large enough for two or three people to comfortable stand in,
as it oversees the entire ship, the rusted old rotting ship which is
almost perched against the Southern rocks.

The Head of the Lockheart~
{x Here is the front of the ship, where it points outwards alittle
more, with a point of the old handrails.  The ship is still at a
seventy or eighty degree slant to the Southward direction, so this
ship is not going anywhere for a while.  The skies above the ship are
somewhat cloudy and gray, giving the ship a darker appearance, with
the harsh cold winds howling around here.

The Deck of the Lockheart~
{x Becareful, here is the deck of the lockheart, which is at a
slant downwards to the south, on the old deck, had it not been for
the handrail, it would be dangerous.  The floor here is covered with
small holes and mysterious old bloodstains which have turned a
brownish color.  The sound of old creeks can be heard from the ship
along with a chain rattling from the rusted anchor which sits to the
North overside the ship past the broken handrail.

The Deck of the Lockheart~
{x After hopping onto the ship from the rocks which can be seen to
the South, onto the opening in the broken old handrails, the floor is
slightly slippery and can be slipped right back off again if not the
wood have been so aged and worn.  Now somewhat rough, those gray
planks which you stand upon and warped and filled with holes, the
entire ship now creeks and shifts from the waves brushing up against
the side of the ship.
