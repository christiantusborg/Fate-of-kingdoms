{yNetros, slay these annoyances and return to the mansion with
proof of your success (a leg, a hand, a head or an eye) I assume you
remember your way into my mansion?  No.  I did not think so, follow
the northern path from Sanaria, at first crossing head west, past
Beathuma Castle.  Further you will see in sight my lair.

The Third Level is quite similar to the first two.  What is really
different is the size of it.  It seems a perfect _ShRuNk_ replica of
the previous floor.  Four magical torches, at every corner end of the
room, light brightly the room also giving a faint smell of cinnamon. 
The room is recovered by a thick red carpet, heading east and west

Bouchard has arisen from his grave, and brought
forth with him his skeletals warriors of old.
Under the command of Lord Corwin, the city of Sanaria
is now under battle with the undead army. The city would of
fallen had it not been for the leadership of Lord Borrin
General-Captain of the Sanaria Garrison. The undead army has
been pushed back to the gates of the graveyard, where they now
reassemble in greater numbers to invade and conquer Sanaria once
more, now that the Skeletal Lords have awakened. Lord Borrin
has sent dispatches to various major cities seeking aid, and is
hiring anyone willing to aid in the defence of Sanaria.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=--
{y                       Players Objective       {x                   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=--
 
1. To hold the defence of the city until reinforcement arives.
2. To aquire certain magical artifacts that that can defeat the
   skeletal lords, who are immune to ordinary damage.
3. To solve certain riddles in the acquiring of the magical artifacts.
4. Ehh.....need ideas..on what the players can go thru...i dont want it
   to resemble too much the dragon quest either..
 
 
SideNote: It could be made more crazy if we have Zhiran involved,
like from the graveyard comes the dead, and from the southern gate,
you have Zhiran's army attacking.
 
Notes: Skeletal Lords would be old Horde members,
Up to now, theres Warmaster Corwin, Lord Bouchard The Enforcer of Death
 
Another Objective: Read history and find out a way to emprison the
leaders of the undead back into their tomb. Leaderless, the zombies
will fall into ash and the skeltons will break and combust.

{y                       Quest Procedure{x
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=--
 
When the players begin, the gates of Sanaria will be barred. Zhiran's army
will be camped at the outskirts of Sanaria, preparing to attack. Zhiran's
army is divided into parties each led by its own Commander. Zhiran has chosen
to attack in 3 waves. To enable both lowbies and highbies to fight in the
defense, this is how it will proceed.
                       {GWest Gate              East Gate{x
{BWave 1 Mob LvLs:          30                      60
{BWave 2 Mob LvLs:          45                      75
{BWave 3 Mob LvLs:          60                      90
{x
 
This way, the western gate will be for players between level 30-60
while the eastern gate will be for those between 60-81.

This wide hallway leads to the most captivating and magnificent
gate of them all.  Built and crafted by magic, the steel that forms
the two doors of the Third Gates is of purple color.  Even from this

other two, the gates are equality maintained and form a wonderful
sight as they reflect sunlight forming a colored beam in the sky.

to walk.  To the north lies the mines.  The road south suddenly is
blocked by adjacent trees forming immense walls.  You now have no
