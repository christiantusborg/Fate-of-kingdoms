any1 knows why my alignment has changed from good to neutral?
I tot alignment is a permanent thingy in this mud. Could it be
becoz i've been casting ' animate corpse'? My character is
a 'good' character since creation. Hope a imm can help change
it back for me. thks for reading.

to answer your question elminster, animate dead is, as
far as i know, the only way to change your alignment
on the whole mud.  it takes about 4 casts to turn your
align from good to evil, and you'll stay evil forever.
 
considering you're a fairly high level to have it, stay
neutral and quit casting it.  it's a crappy spell, and
neutrals can wear all eq (almost) = )

I hope more class/race combo types are allowed. For example
like drow clerics, merma paladins, arial monks and ogre mages.
Some races are not very popular presently and I think this idea
will help. This mud also need a wider range of characters so we
dun just see dwarves, human and elves only, as paladins. Any1

i don't see why we couldn't allow all races to be all
classes.  i mean, just because an ogre is stupid doesn't
mean he can't be a mage.  he just wouldn't be a good
mage = P
 
He'd be bad at spellcasting and couldn't cast a lot of
things without resting, but with the magical power he
lost, he'd gain physical power.  He'd be a stupid mage,
but he'd be a BIG mage.  i see potential in that.

correct me if im wrong, but arent ogres supposed to be evil/neutral?
even though they arent now, that being changed it would eliminate

should be able to use that race. Most of the big lots of hp classes
are evil so you wouldnt have any high hp healers, problem solved.

3: " can charge more than once during combat.
  Hmm well i just make charge init only for this reson
  You charge into a fight but you charge next round when you close
  to the one you fight, and if have have to use that reound to run out
  to be able to charge next how will you be able to use normal attacks

Okay now i think Giants need a real big upgrade.
  first of all you would have noticed no high level mortals are giants
this is because giants are weaker and dumber than ogres/trolls so why
would you want to be a giant?
  Giants could be really good for role playing but they aren't anygood
for playing.
 
  So i was thinking maybe you should rewrite them and form a new class
from them (but still called giants).
 first of all give them some brains about as much as a troll
but keep them not as strong as a troll but still pretty strong.
  give them a reasonable con, and then give them something cool
like make them resistant to cold or heat.
 
  if you did this i think we would see more giants in the world

 I think the Maligner spell animate dead2 should not be 
based on a timer but on a limit system.
 
 By this I mean that we dont have to stand around waiting
to make a new wussy zombie but that we can make a certain
amount of them without a timer but it has a limit based on
your level.
 
 Something like you can make a new zombie for every three
levels you are. So that high levels would be able to make
hoards of zombies but lower levels wouldnt be so powerful.
 
 Really in actuallity, anyone the same level as me could
fairly easily kill my zombie, or even 10 of them, I just
think that the animate dead2 spell is to weak now, and it
is better when it doesnt work on a timer, but if thats to
powerful for everyone then I think a limit of zombies per level
would be more fair, Same goes for summon dead.
 
 I suggest 1 new zombie per three levels. I think two levels
it to strong but four is to weak. Don't forget it costs mana
as is so its not like you can make them that fast.

although ive not yet (touch wood) been involved in pks
i think it would depend on the reason whether the note should be open

if the reason is rp that is only relevant to the killer 
then just to the imms makes sense
i think it would be a useful option though

"will you like to be my frined?" and if he then reaplyed
yes he use it a pk reson
 
So i think when you hire some to kill someone
You write a note the admins and the person you wanna have to do
the killing.
 
What must be in this note?
  1. how much you pay.
  2. when you have it done
  3. you reson to get the killing done (this don't ONLY to admins)
  4. And who you hire
 
The one hired Must note back if he accept it or not
And rember you must pay more it cost the murder
 
And a last thing DON'T put bounty on someone with and alt or
hire an alt and don't use bounty board
You put 1000 gold one some one and then kill him for the bonty

Well i lost track of the charge  argument, but if you 
were to allow people to re-charge then
thier victim would have the chance to flee, call me
stupid but if i saw the person with a big long sharp
stick backing up id taker my chance and run
 
I really like the idea of buying resistances, you could
cost trains, not gold
 have it so you could only get resistance to one specific 
thing. and id should
cost trains, not gold

Heya. I just thought.. well, in the old times, like 2 years or so
ago, takeda made up this day, called Double Exp day, where you know,
we used to get double exp. It would be fun if we made one this year too.
