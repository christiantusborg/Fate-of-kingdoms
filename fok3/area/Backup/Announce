My read on the canidates first:
Tarrant : shows a lot of promise, however there are some concerns
     regarding his level of responsible and some  jerkyness and
     perhaps some minor cheating in the past.
 
Shamus : Really wants to help out the mud.  Feels a responsibility
     to the mud.  I think he is also a promising canidate, but he
     has not shown the greatest level of maturity.
 
Wotan : Has cheated and is generally a pain in the ass, however he
     really wants to help.  Still, I tend to lean against Wotan.
 
Tarion : A little powertrippy but has generally done a good job for
       us.   I don't feel comfortable with him in an admin position,
       but I think he should be involved in policy decisions.
 
Kleodyn : Well, he's my brother and I like him, sue me.  My personal
      favorite canidate to become and admin.  He's done a good job
      with the help files and is well liked.  He knows the basics
     of roleplay and I have confidence he won't cheat.
 
Veovis : Not on enough, didn't really impress when he was entrusted
     with the head builder job.  I don't think he is in the running.
 
   I think we should hire Tarrant, Shamus, and Kleodyn at the
Admin in Training level.  We'll see what they are capable of and hire
one or two as admins and the rest, perhaps as assistants.
Let me know admins, this is your call as much as mine.

I would agree completely with Kleodyn being promoted
to an administrator, namely because like Derkec said
he is trustworthy, very friendly and kind, seems to
know a lot about roleplaying and compared with the
rest of the canididates he is the best choice. But
I do not think Tarrant would be a good choice at all
for an assistant. He has done some extensive cheating
in the past on Fate2, and he is also very good irl
friends with Huma. Shamus is just an idiot, but who
knows, he might be good as an assistant.

Subject Wiyl/Kovan and Quall~
Text
I had a small run in with these two people earlier today.
From what I got from their two "testimonies," Quall was going
to attack Kovan but when Kovan found out he quit and logged
back on with Wiyl.  Kovan/Wiyl claims that he was dying of
hunger or thirst and that is why he quit.  Seems more like
avoiding Pk to me, but oh well.  Quall then started harassing
Wiyl through OOC but after I revoked that through tells.  I
took them both into The Void so I could figure out what was
going on.  Wiyl demanded a balefire for Quall's harassment
using profanity 4 times while Quall wanted punishment for
Kovan's quitting out of Pk.  After about 10 minutes of back
and forth yelling between the two, I found a punishment for
each of them without having to use balefire or slay.  I gave
Quall 2 warnings and deducted exp from him and gave Wiyl a
simple one warning.  I chose to punish Quall more harshly
due to the higher level of evidence against him.  If either
of them reach 3 warnings with, a slay + full loot will occur.
I said the warnings would disappear in a month real time.
Just wanted to let you know what is going on since I know
there will be a note or email from Wiyl complaining about
this further.

Sorry Exp, didnt mean to come off so harsh, i know most of you are
good people and wouldnt do anything to mess with another persons
creation. I just didnt want someone going and changing my mob 
without telling/explaining to me.
 I'm telling you now it is way overpowered but it isnt in gameplay.
It is strictly for my fun and it helps me to RP and interact with 
players more on their level. If they wish to try and attack me then 
they may. I usually warn them strongly against it before they do but
you know what kind of ego heads we have here and some still do. So
if that is the case im not going to be held responcible for player
deaths. If it is my fault one of them dies though i will take full
responcibility and give reimburse and whatever else i see  fit.
 So once again, sorry if i insulted any of you, i just really kinda
proud that i found a way to start some good RP.

I know I have not been around much since I retired (Around May), but 
when I came on today I was shocked at what I saw.  I saw two level 
80 players hitting unspeakables during each round of combat.  When I 
pointed this out to Porthios, he gasped, and for the first time, 
realized that these two LEVEL 80 players existed.  I do not mean to 
offend you, but the competence of these immortals that work for Fate,
the head builder and assistants, terribly scares me.  This is part of 
the reason why I retired because of the terrible cheating and 
capabaility of our Immortals to watch over mortals, build areas, and 
catch mortals cheating.  I just wrote this note to you in hope that you 
have a plan waiting for implementation to fix Fate...it seems the only 
way out of this mess is again to close Fate and reopen to Fate IV, but 
then what is going to stop the same thing from happening to Fate IV 
that has happened on Fate I, II and III?  I really hope we can fix this 
up.  Thanks.  Cedric

Subject Kovan~
Text
He sent me a log of what happened and I have been looking
over it quite carefully.  It appears that Kovan was planning
on killing Ginks even though he knew Ginks didn't set the
hit on him.  He also says it doesn't matter because anyone
can just make up a reason.  It is my opinion that Kovan
should be slayed do his continual and knowledgable being
right at the edge of the Pk rules.  I don't know if you
want to hear my personal opinion of all that should happen
but I'll just tell you anyway.
 
1) Slay Takahashi.  Give gear he took from Kovan to Kovan.
2) Slay Kovan.  Give his gear back to Ginks.
 
  This would make it so nobody actually comes out ahead in
this except Ginks who is the only true innocent.  We cannot
allow people to formulate Pk reasons after Pk.  This will
only lead to further Pk problems.  This is just what I have
thought of after looking back at the log and conferring w/
Derkec.

Subject Kovan Balefired for breaking rules too much~
Text
Someone had to do it better sooner then later, I usually 
really hate to be the one to have to punish people but this
one really had to stop, Kovan was thinking here was his little
playground, killing who ever he felt like it without rp reasons,
acting with disrespect to all, mortal and immortal alike, he 
would curse in almost every sentence at least twice at times and
generally was making himself a nuisance.  Kovan killed killed 
Songmeng last friday and did not write a note, he killed ginks
for no good reason, he repeatedly killed Songmeng declaring he
would kill her till she deletes.  This type of behavior is 
just not tolerated.  One must follow the rules.  It had to
happen Kovan.  Please don't do this with your next character 
or we may have to site ban you, I really don't want to have to
do that.
Let this be a lesson to everyone, I suggested everyone read
help rules and help cheating now

Well how to write this note i don't know where to start
 
1. Whining it bich to hear when you immortal and trying to do good job
   so can't you stop biching to other immortal but be?
   and not do it to much then i get pissed and if you realy think
   some thing is wrong note to me and i will look at it
   I know most immortal did become immortals to help out and
   not to get bitch at soo be nice.
 
2. Like Half of the mortals RP is soo bad i don't think it even comming
   close to RP
   How do you make it better?
   Now it you turne to be comming up with the ideas i am slowly
   running out of them
 
3. Some days i think of just saying fuck this mud and then move to
   other one where i hope to no whining and complaining is
   DON'T ever take Immortal and this mud forgranted
   How many of you think funny to be the Basterd Immortal who say NO
  and slay when you do any thing wrong
 
4. Low levels don't aske high levels to get you eq it pain as well
   If they like to help they will give you eq and do other stuff for you
   I rember when i was mortal when ever i loged one did aske me for eq
   it was pain and i then stopped give out eq to anyone i did think
  it was better to sac stuff then give it out. if you like help from 
   the high level aske one time and if they say no ther much be a
   reson why they do it rember it need to be fun for all!!!

I've thought of doing this a couple of times but
never had the time to do it up until now.  I was
contemplating putting together to imm only "help
files" that would contain names of certain ppl
on the mud.  One would be cheaters and one would
be Rp.  We could create a point system to keep
track of this.  That would make it so players
who cheated or broke rules often would be punished
harder and people who used Rp a lot would get
higher bonuses.  Just something I've been toying
with.  If everyone agrees on this as a good idea,
I'll start the files with everyone at a clean
slate.  Please respond.

Subject Rp~
Text
In an effort to increase Rp here, I have begun to create
a list of people that Rp, and how much they do as well as
how well.  This would allow immortals to keep track of who
consistantly has good Rp.  Those people who meet those small
standards would gain a higher level of benefits than those
who Rp only from time to time.  This list will start from
scratch so all players have an equal chance to get on the
list.  This list will be readable by all players and a point
system will keep track of Rp.  All past Rp will not help to
earn you a place on the list, but I assume that those who
already show high levels of Rp will continue doing so and
will not have a problem finding themselves at the top.  With
any luck, I will be updating the Rp list on a weekly basis.
The list will be on 'help Rp'.  I'll let everyone know if
a different spot is chosen as this is not a final decision.
Thanks.

Hi all, sorry due to exams this week I was unable to log
on much, but I have now composed a list of prices for
housing which should not be too unreasonable I hope,
plus locations for where you will be able to buy them.
Currently only Sanaria and Elvandar are available for
locations, but in the near future you shall be able to
purchase houses in Gerighelm, High Tower (for spellcasters
only), New Thalos and Valley of the Titans. Specific
locations may be charged more due to their prestige or lack
thereof. The prices will be as follows:
 
House: one room plus one piece of large furniture will
be 75k gold.
 
1 large piece of furniture(bed, table, etc): 10k
 
1 small piece of furniture(chair, cabinet etc): 5k
 
1 item(drinks, food, jewelry etc): 5k
mobs(pets, "family" members): 25k per mob
(guards cost an extra 25k and all mobs have set level, hp/mana,
and no vulns or resistances)
 
keys: 1k per key
 
portals: not currently available but will be in near future
 
doors: locked- 5k, pickproof- 10k extra, no_pass: 10k extra
 
Please note me on personal with the details of how you would
like your house designed, no descriptions though please we
can discuss that in person. Thanks.

Well, i've been waiting for a nay from the other imms and
have yet to hear one, so here goes.  There is a quest planned
for tomorrow night with yours truly running it.  For those
who were around for my previous one, yes, this is part two
of it.  It will probably start around 9:00 pm eastern time
as long as I dont get suckered into entertaining guests with
my grandparents or something like that.  If it becomes necessary,
I'll postpone the start time to 10 eastern time.  I'm sorry to
those of you overseas who might have conflicts with the time,
but this is the only chance i'll have free before about August
25 or 26.  There is one note - you play at your own risk.  If
you die and a piece of eq rots cause it is over the limit, we
won't replace it.  However, if oyu die and lose something that
is rot_death, as long as i have a note from you about you using
it b4 the quest starts, we will look into reimbursing it if its
lost.  This is not a definite thing, and I still have been unable
to get approval fromt he other imms on this, but i'm sure they'll
agree. So, let's recap:
Quest, tomorrow, Saturday August 5th
starting hopefully 9 pm, but no later than 10 pm
you play at your own risk as far as eq goes

First of all i just want to say that im sorry bout asking
other imms for commands when u asked me not to.
Second i didnt exactly ask for more commands i just said that
my commands suck and i cant do anything with these commands.
Third i didnt mean to piss u off but i didnt c u on bout a week
and i think im on the mud A LOT of hours but all these hours
i dont do anything because of my lack of commands.
any time a mortal asks me about something i just have the same answer
" i don't know, don't have that command, note the admins"
and i think that i could help a lot more if i could have
some more options and commands.
FOR EXAMPLE:
i could check some logs to c if people lying about reimburse and stuff

Subject Mortal Gods~
Text
OK, to go along with what Explorer has just noted, I find myself
a bit annoyed. Everytime i do my job by punishing someone they seem
to have this idea they are god and can get me fired. Well you guys
think im too harsh on you then you better wake up. The immortals have
had it, you want to whine,complain, and cuss then we'll start handing
out punishments as follow:
 
* Whining or complaining via note was already taken care of by Explorer,
   read his last note if you dont know what im talking about.
 
* Whinning or Complaining on OOC or other public channels will result
   in pretty much the same outcome, maybe a bit less harsh, maybe not.
 
* Cussing on channels:
     - 1st time - Smite
     - 2nd time - -100 xp for every letter in the sentence with the
        curse word.
     - 3rd time - Your life is in the hands of me and the other admins
 
 This note isnt supposed to be mean but we're fed up with all your
crap. The greater part of the immortal staff is at the point where
they could just shrug if they got fired and im among them. This is
just a fair warning to everyone who insist on how crappy fate is yet
continue to play here. WE'RE NOT FORCING YOU TO STAY, IF YOU DONT LIKE
US THEN LEAVE.

I was planning on starting it during the Quest that
is to be run by Sarlos, but since that got delayed, I
am officially opening the board, NOW.  Any RP that is
seen will be recorded into a file and at the end of
every week, I will go through that file and designate
points for the Rp that is posted there.  Once that is
done, I will go on to the Rp board (help rp) and place
everybody where they ought to be.  At the end of every
month in real time, rewards will be given out.  The
higher on the list you place, the better your reward
will be.  The board is currently empty so all players
have an equal chance to get themselves on it.  I do
believe that is all I have to say for now.

to level higher then 40 you need 40 rp points
b) Give much bigger bonus for rp and much bigger punisment for
lag of doing it.
 
2. to whineing from mortals
Will this a hard one for me i don't realy like just delete all who
whine so i will like some ideas
 
3. To few activ immortals
Sack all inavtive immortals and hire new ones and give all a personal

4. To much cheating

Hi, I decided that I'm going to run a long-term quest
here, in light of a new addition to a certain area.
The quest will be to retrieve the item called "a sight".
Now, I'm sure a few of you know how difficult it is to
get this item from on Fate II and how only a handful
did. (Dain being one of them)
Well, the path to the sight is made even harder now. Very
hard, damn hard. BUT I assure you it's worth it. As it
stands, this item, "a sight" is now most likely the best
in the game. So if you can get this item, not only will
you be able to proudly wear it, but you get an item of
your choic restrung to whatever you want, plus 5000 exp
bonus and 50k gold.
So, happy hunting. And remember, the repop rate of this
item is only 10%. ;)

Subject QUEST~
Text
Ok everyone, this time it's for real.  Next Saturday,
September the 3rd, 2000, I will run part two of the quest
series i started at the beginning of the summer.  So, here
are the gritty details:
A big part of doing well in it will be roleplaying, and as
   such, you will be rewarded extra xp at the end based on
   the amount of rolepalying you did during the quest.
 
Quest eq Will be given as a prize (for those of you who care)
 
You will play at your own peril.  If you die, no eq will
   be reimbursed.  (Except, perhaps, quest eq, but i will
   let higher admins take care of that)
 
It will be a combo of hack and slash and roleplaying, enough
   to satisfy all your desires.  And, there are parts available
   for all levels.  A safe level would be 25 or so, so it is
   advised that if you wish to participate you get there before
   the quest starts.
 
I dunno what more I can say but 'be there or be square'.  It
would be best to have at least 20 ppl online for this, as it would
be more fun and all, so make sure everyone is there!

It was brought to my attention that some newer people may
be unaware of some of the gorund rules during a quest.  They
mainly just follow along the lines of common curtosey, but
I feel they need to be mentioned.
 
1) There will be NO pkilling during the quest.  None at all.
   If you pk during it, severe punishments will follow.
 
2) No looting a corpse of a questor who has died is allowed.
   Unless, of course, you have permission of the dead person.
   Again, severe punishments will follow.
 
3) Everyone must participate.  If you join the quest, but sit
   in the healer the whole time and make no effort to help at
   all, and I catch, I will personally find the largest,
   meanest, ugliest, and smelliest troll I can find (most likely
   Soma) and have him sit on you while I proceed to tickle you
   mercilessly (not to mention, you will get no quest eq, no
   xp rewards, and, if I am in a particularly nasty mood, i'll
   dock you xp for not roleplaying)
 
4) Dont get Sarlos upset with you while he is running a quest
   cause he is likely to turn you into a pink bunny rabit and
   parade you around sanaria with a leash around your neck and
   a large badge saying your name.
 
Ok, so 4 isn't quite serious, but you get the point.  Play
nice, and everything will be all right.

me he can turn off the making of corpses so that when we
kill the mortals, they appear with their eq.  Now, to back
up a little.  They will be storming the tower of a powerful
commander.  Trying to retrieve and amulet that makes him
basically invulnerable to anything that cna be thrown at
him.  To do it, a large force will have to attract all the
guards in the castle to the main gate to fight a long and
drawn out battle, while a smaller, secret force, sneaks in
through a cellar entrance and tries to make it through a
maze into the tower.  Now, at the main gate, all the mortals
MUST be killed.  I repeat, they MUST be killed.  As they
die, you also have to pay attention, and transfer them to
the prison, the vnum of which I don't remember right now
but I will give it to you on that night.  Anyways, gd, gt,
and another channel, i forget which, will be disabled.  As
the morts are killed and transed, they also need to be
nochanneled.  This is so that the ones in prison can't talk
to the ones still fighting to tell them what going on.  It
would be best, probably, to nochannel them and the transfew
them.  Us immortals will be inhabiting the bodies of mobs
I have already creted.  Now, there needs to be at least one
mage to summon (or trans if necessary) back any mortal who
runs from combat, so we can ensure they all die.  I can't
tell you any more, cause i don't want to leave open any
chance that it will leak to the mortals.  But suffice it to
say that they will all end up in the cellar, and I should be
able to handle it from there.  If anyone has questions about
this, please note them to me.

Hello, Fate. I am Conrad, the new admin of roleplaying.
 
I recently accepted the position, so I will not be exert-
ing full authority on the subject until I believe I am
sufficiently "in the loop" to make judgement calls.
Eventually, I hope to be able to help make this an enjoy-
able game for those gamers who are tired of same-old
gaming.  I appreciate *constructive* feedback and accept
it freely and at any time; through tells, notes, or ICQ
messages (ask me for my number if you want it).  Feel
free to either direct your thoughts either privately
to me, or publically on boards 4 and 5.
 
I have no other updates at this time. Thank you.

Subject We give you skills you give us rp~
Text
Here's the deal.  We are have given the players in kingdoms
new and wonderful skills.  This does not come without any new
responsibilities or debts to the staff.   You guys owe us RP and lots
of it.  All the kingdoms (i believe) have skills that are dependant
on rank withing the kingdom.  That means that we are certaintly going to
us demotion as our first line of warfare against those who don't RP.
   The primary responsibility here is on the kings.  You
must make sure your kingdom is not embarrassed by having a
high ranking player who doesn't rp well.  Let me suggest a cap
of rank 3 for those who don't care about rp, and rank 8 for those
that try but just can't see to get it right.
   Should the kings fail in their duties, then the sponser imm
for that kingdom will need to step in and take action (with the
kings permission of course) should their be a conflict it will
be resolved by me.  I will also be adding some occassional and
random checks that could cause me to demote someone or request
the king to promote them.  
   All standing rules for rp are still in effect, I'm just trying
to let everyone know what I expect of everyone.  This is really not
a new rule, it is just enforcement of the one that we set up 3 months
before fate 3 opened.

Should the kingdom as a whole fail to roleplay or manage

Dont tell me that its okay to transfer eq between alts
because you share the character. If you share the character,
not only are you breaking the rules on ONE count, but
if you transfer EQ to ANY OF THE ALTS OF ANY OF THE PEOPLE
WHO PLAY THAT CHARACTER, YOU ARE EQUIPMENT TRANSFERRING.
