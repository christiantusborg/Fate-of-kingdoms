Outside the Church~
You stand before the Grand Church of Thera.  The church is
intricately carved out of the finest marble, polished everyday buy a
group of pixies hired from the pixie forest.  Holding the entrance to
the church up is four giant marble pillars inlayed with gold and
platinum ropes.  Before the doors stand two giant gargoyles that have
volunteered to protect the church.  The doors to the church are very
tall and are made of very thick oak held together with the strongest
of all iron and the hinges are almost as big as a standard human.

The bell room is where the HUGE iron bell hangs that is rung every
hour on the hour.  The bell hangs directly above the door in the
floor to get in here.  There are small rooms built on to the north,
south, east and west of here.  The bell was carved by one of the
finest iron workers in Thera.  There is a small etching on the bottom
of the bell.

In a room atop the steeple there is a window.  The window
overlooks Thera for miles and miles.  The floor is made of wooden
planks.  The walls are made of stone.  There are obstructions laying
all over the room that the church has left here, unwanted things that
