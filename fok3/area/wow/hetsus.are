a tan body from working out in the field for his times, now appearing
to be in his fourties.  He wears a tacky looking Camo coat.  Never
muscular, he was a skinny man with a shriled looking body.

{x A cross between a market area and sub-urban part of town with
smaller roads of dirt, lead in a winding area of houses and
buildings, some stores laying from either side of the alleyway.  A
slum would be an insult to this part of the district held by the
opposing force of the Kaesuo, but calling it an ordinace is
overstepping it's boundries.

of bricks in a massive spiral through the roads into a large area
inbetween a few buildings.  Many men roam here, especially those in
clothing that resembles that of the Zagashima.  To the south can be
easily noticed a small wall, small of course with a set of thick iron
gates and a very long and tall house, with the banners of Zagashima
hung from them.

paces wide, possibly even fifteen at most points.  Half of the dirt
covered ground is kept with wooden strips of wood, slightly warped,
but now a pseudo sidewalk for those who live within this neighborhood
to walk upon.

{x Through all the roads and alleys, at the dead heart is a large
long building that stretches ontop of a large upraised platform of
stones and morter, 4 feet from the roads.  A large wall stretches
infront of the building with a small yard with a few trees, and a
large metal gate here.  Aside from the gate are small posts with
passage doors for the gaurdsmen to keep this house protected.  Going
through that gate and into the large poarch has opened sliding doors
of wood and rice paper, always opened.  Through is a large hallway
with red rugs and wooden floors and drywalls everywhere.

either side, though no doors but instead folding paper frames to set
infront of them.

{x The base seems to be an old building which was once abandoned
but now is occupied by the Zagashima faction.  This hallway is long
and very wide, about 12 feet wide with a red crug strip on the wooden
floor.  For such an old building, it must have been redone with
shiney floors and wood halfway up the walls with white drywall for
the rest and the ceiling.  Windows occasionally align the walls with
small fancy vases or pots filled with plants.

{x This area is somewhat a pseudo room, from a large and long
hallway, which was quite large flows into this room which from the
north has a large doorway opening, three times the usual doorway. 
Other doorways align each other sides.  A long table aligns the flat
wall to the South with a sword rack and sword upon it, though only
decorative.  Along the wall shelves containing bonsai trees is shoved
up against the East wall and a small basket sits along the West.  For
a high traffic area, the decorative touch gives it a very tranquil
feeling to it.

windows of the room with a gentle breeze which blows through.  Not
much was in the large room, a small wrapping of pads and blankets up
in one corner, and a folding glass painted wall in the other corner,
the rest was empty other than a large square pit, perfectly carved. 
In this pit was sand and rocks, sifted to resemble some small garden,
for a strange but beautiful design.

and a large bronze ring which leads down to the cellar.

Zagashima.  Once an abandoned building, referbished and turned into a
more beautiful place of intelligence.  With a robust style of new art
and styles of beauty, bought by the fine wealth which was attained by
business by the new master.  A corner of the strangely shaped
building is herewith a strange shelf with many books on them.  A few
tables and pillows sit here next to a few set of paper windows,

basically a massive square area with a set of massive doorways
spanding ten feet across.  Each door was framed with wood, same with
the floor.  No windows were in this corridor, yet it remained light
during times.  Nothing was in the the hallways other than a mirror on
one side of the open wall, leaning up against the adobe wall.

nearly fourty to fifty feet in lengthand dozens of feet deep.  The
bridge however seems to support the weight and can carry many people
across the old wooden brdige, in it's grand splender.  Beautifully
etched red handrails guide travelers across the katsuimatsu river
safely.

On the Katsuimatsu ~
{x At this, the center of the bidge which has stood here for a
near century, wittnessing the bloodshed and beauty of hetsushima.  It
was a simple wooden bridge, arching over the Katsuimatsu river, with
heavy log planks to support the much weight.  Two large red handrails
settle on the side to lean on and prevent any from falling into the
deep and rapid river, nearly fourty to fifty feet in length.  The
bridge seems worn, but well kept by the townspeople, obviously holes
and other missing spots have been repaired perfectly over the
ranvenous years in which it has stood.

On the Katsuimatsu~
{x The path finally leads to the Katsuimatsu river and it's long
arced bridge.  Constructed of all wood, The bridge extends over the
deep and powerful river, having withstood the current of time and
corrosion of the water to stand at this point.  The architectual
standpoint was almost flawless with thick posts and sturdy beams and
even a fine handrail, occassionaly painted red to keep a festive look
over the Katsuimatsu.

Before the Residence~
{x The path to the ancient residence is that of a dirt path,
surrounded by beautiful green trees with wofting leaves and rich
earthen barks.  A few bricks in the ground to form a pseudo path lead
straight to the large old styled house in the distance.  Just
branching off from the large city to a gentle path gives an amazing
contrast from civilization and country.

proclaimed and ridchest hierarchy of the city's construct, the only
man with somewhat a firm military.  A tall mansion sits here, near
box shaped, and large in size.  Firm doors of wood stand here, ready
to keep out any intruders, however not a significant protection.

polished so much that the reflection was almost as clear as a still
water pond, crystal like in its complection.  Long hallways of white
and wood stretch through the cooridor, with many windows which fold
lay on the inside garden wall, allowing a beautiful visage.

The First Generals Room~
{x After building his trust within the Daimyo in fine battles, the
Daimyo was impressed, and then gave a room to his general in his fine
mansion.  The room must be the largest of all the general's rooms,
and impressive as it was filled with many suits of armor and weapons,
paintings and small plants on the furnature.  An actual foreign style
bed which rose off the floor of wood nearly an inch rested in the
corner of the room, with a set of worn intriquit armor layed upon it.

ground dyed with the finest berries.  It still seemed to retain most
of it's color even though the massive two foot tall table sat upon it
with many plain beige pillows.  A few windows aligned the south walls
to show the front of the building and a nice clearing.

soft luxurious sheets of cotton and silks.  A sinple table with a
bowl and pitcher of water sit next to the bed, near a small closet to
put things in.  A window of paper and wood is on the Westward wall to
view out to the fields and city.

floors and walls, and other things to keep the room dry and cool,
with odd shaped planked walls.  There is only a single tiny window up
near the ceiling to allow alittle sunlight to fill up the room.  It
is slightly musky in the armorywith old spears and swords sitting
around, well taken care of after every day of harsh use.  A small
statue sits at the center of the backwall, easily visible past all
waist sized racks in the center of the room, and ceiling length racks
and shelves against them.

white and wooden walls.  A large window is settled to the East wall
beside a large desk and a rug to sit on.  Large closet and shelves
are built into this room, some containing clothes, statues or kami's.
A large wrapped up bed roll is in the corner, by a large rack for
weapons, clothing and armor.  The room is mainly lit by the
window,though half melted wax candles still sit here and there on
iron stands or even on the shelves.

and a pillow along the large Eastern window.  Many calligraphy
paintings hang around the rooms, even with scrolls of mon and
certificates of masters in romanji and others.  Large 3 foot thin
buckets lay in the corners and in the closets filled with many papers
and maps and scrolls, what an intellectual looking room.

Kaesuo's Room~
{x Here is the master bedroom to the Kaesuo residence it seems,
where none other than the Daimyo Udagawa Kaesuo would have to reside.
A large western styled bed sits here, still somewhat low to the
ground however, with the space to spare, it is quite the luxury item.
The walls of white and wood are covered with many war swords and
armor from his friends or great foes from the past, along with
massive portraits of a foreign style or bust of Lord Kaesuo,
ancestors and younger generations.  Large windows are to the north,
allowing the sun and fresh breeze to pour into the musty room, and
allow it to cool off.  A large desk and set of cabinets lay aligned
to the wall to the north, containing many unused documents.  This,
such a great room, is for none other but the great Daimyo.

wooden floor but a small bed mat and rice paper folding wall.  A few
racks of wood with tiny pink kimonos sat there feet away from a
vanity like object containing a small mirror and a mass ammount of
makeup.  A few toys sat around the room, mainly dolls and a ball or
two, the little master of this room could obviously not learn how to
clean up.  However, obviously being one of the youngest kin, it was
not easy to blame her.

upraised platform with a seat built in and a massive shrine lining
the southern wall.  This room was not meant to see the thrill of a
fight.  From this room much can be scene from the wooden beam posts
that had the large viewport to the doors of the dojo from afar, and a
large view of many of the trainees.

packed adobe wall of thick dirt clumped bricks.  The wall only
stretches two feet off the ground, but runs nearly five feet deep, of
clear and beautiful sparkling blue waters.  This massive round pool,
nearly the size of a 15 food diameter reaches from a adobe lined
stream, manmade from the Katsuriver.

structures are present in this small village other than a few
primitive buildings of wood and adobe.  A large well is errected out
of the complete center out of a cold gray stone which a vital flow of
pure water flows.

Koi Road~
{x The koi is a fine street that runs through the Hetsushima which
appears to meet near the Katsuimatsu river, the main water source
that cuts directly above the main portion of the Hetsushima city. 
This road seems to be one of the finest with a smooth and unlumpy set
of fine light colored dirt, well kept by the city.  A small ammount
of dirt flies up as the faster villagers pass by, on the koi road. 
Few buildings of a faint color of tan line this road of many
different types, commonly used by the peasents, whether residential
or business.

Koi Road~
{x The long and wide dirt road spands across the long city, nearly
acrossing the entire path despite a few twists and turns.  Many tall
buildings of superior architecture and construction set on this
plane, tall sturdy houses of white and browns line up and down this
street of dust.  Dozens of people walk the street despite the
possible danger, living their day to day lives on Hetsushima.

The Entrance to Hetsushima~
{x The gates of Hetsushima were a simple one, a wall of 4 feet
high with large wooden tiles that resembled a roof, that spread along
most of the perimeter of the city, occasionally breaking with a large
gap.  The gates were made of a large wooden tori, spanding near
fifteen feet wide.  This allowed that long dirt path to flow from the
rest of the country into the small village.  A small broken down
wagon sits here also, near the entrance of the town, no one ever
cared to fix.

Yagamoto Street~
{x Parts of this large village seem to be functioning quite well,
this road seems to be a long and elaborate one throughout the entire
long city, stretching and bending through the area.  It is a long and
very thick road, enough for almost four to five carraidges to pass
by, while buildings of tans and browns and grays lay on either side. 
Lots of doors of cloth lay on these buildings, people trying to keep
to themselves while in these reclusive streets.

Yagamoto Street~
{x Traveling down the long and wide dirt road, many buildings
could be observed.  Many buildings of adobe and wood sit up and down
the dirt path that looks beaten.  Many people walk up and down going
about their business - soldiers, citizens, and vendors alike. 
Yagamoto street is the longest road which stretches throughout the
massive Hetsushima city.

The Yagamoto and Kemushi Intersection~
{x The cross section between the two roads, the Yagamoto and the
Kemushi was much like a rounded fork leading to a huge alleyway.  The
Kemushi street is nothing but a tiny dirt like road with massive
buildings of plaster and adobe surrounding them.  From appearance the
Kemushi road only appeared to be a few dozen steps either way,
possibly being no more than fifty to sixty paces in length.

with a huge wall that stood nearly six feet tall of a thick adobe and
a tiny roof like structure.  A heavy gate of metal bars usually were
stuck together to surround the massive lushy green fields of the
office building.  This building appeared to be more than just regular
building, for it was the government building for Hetsushima.

The Yokijima Rice Field~
{x These rocky areas are on a slight hill, which can see the vast
vegetation of the carefully worked fields.  The feilds are an amazing
seight, the hills arching downwards slightly, and upwards againat the
end, with massive block chunks of land with rails around the well
irrigated ditches of a layer of carefully planted water only an inch
or two.  Much like here, the rocks are settled in this area, massive
boulders of a deep gray settled upon the lush green grasses,
surrounded by the cross shaped light tan path.  To the west could be
seen a shed and to the east a small wooden pavillion.

Outside the Work Drivers Station~
{x This building is a large house, not grand, but that of an
average Hetsushima house, but with a office in the front of it.  A
deck sits here along with other parchments and other helpful tallies
of information.  The building looks slightly warn, the work driver
not needing to actually 'drive' the laborers into much slavery, but
more of coordination.  He happily supplies certain work aides on the
limited budget of this town.

Before the Yokijima Shed~
{x Many large gray rocks surround the shet in almost a mountainas
hill with massive rocks lining the north path of dirt to the rickety
old shed.  The shet appears to only be enough to fit ten people,
being near fifteen by twelve, and made of a simple wood with an
arching pointed roof.  A few dirty windows are here to show the
capacity of all the tools in the shed for the Yokijima.  The path of
a packed tan dirt is surrounded by lush green grasses which grow all
around this area.

The Yokijima Shed~
{x The Yokijima shed is just like any normal tool shed, except
exceptionaly large.  The shed was of a few dozen feet and made of all
wood, finely layered and built solid to outlast any wind or storm. 
The walls and floors were lightly sanded from all sharp or rustic
corners or flats, same with the counters.  Counters aligned most of
the walls and some even jotted out to part of the room where large
scythes, small hooks, gloves, plows and many other tools align the
wall.
