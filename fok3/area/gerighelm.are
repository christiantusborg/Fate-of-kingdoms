The page reads:

went off to find him.  The next day, the archangel Zarchon came to earth,
and asked why the people were suffering.  He was told by the minstrel,
'There are no Heros in this land, and no adventurers,' he said.  'That is why
I am unhappy.'

He asked a passing child, 'Why are you suffering?'
The child replied, 'I have no "role-models"  I am told.  In the old days,
there were many brave warriors, priests, wizards, and rogues.  But not any-
more...'.

So Zarchon took the case to the God Trollz, and his aides, Tass, and Garth.
And Trollz said 'There shall be adventurers again. I command it.'

And it was done, and there were such greats as uidsgfjkjskfauwehfjk

The rest is garbled by time.
