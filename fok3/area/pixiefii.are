A Huge Wisp~
A {WB{wr{Yig{wh{Wt{x Wisp~
A wisp hovers about the branches
~
You see what at first appears to be a star floating above your head.  However
It seems to be moving, and as it nears you, it grows greatly in brightness,
almost blinding you.  This bright entity momentarily flickers, and a glint of
an item, perhaps aiding in its brightness, can be seen from within the mass of
light.

A Noble Fairy~
{WA {YNoble {GFairy{X~
A Noble looking Fairy flies in the middle of the room
~
Before you floats a fairy noble, fluttering quite elegantly.  Dressed from
head to toe, and even to its wings in beautiful and luxurious garments, fitting
this pixie's small body just right.  This fairy seems to possess a certain
majesty about it.  It seems quite content and comfortable with its life, and
you can see that it holds high standards for itself, by the way it dresses, its
posture, and by the way it keeps the canopy of this tree looking beautiful.

A pixie glowing a silvery color flies high overhead
~
A silver gleam seems to float above your head.  At a first glance, it could
be easily mistaken for a hanging decoration of some sort, but as you can see,
it is a pixie, dressed in beautiful silvery pixie attire.  As it flies down a
bit, you can see each piece of this majestic silvery attire was crafted by
a skilled artisan.

A Gold Pixie~

A pixie glowing a soft golden color flies high above
~
A pixie with a soft golden gleam flutters above a branch overhead, looking
almost as if it were a dim lantern.  This pixie's gleam seems to be mostly due
to its beautiful golden armor, with pixie symbols wrought throughout it.  As
you overlook this pixie and its beautiful attire, it smiles at you, and laughs
gleefully as it realizes you are admiring its armor.

A Platinum Pixie~
{XA {WP{wla{Dt{wi{Dn{Wu{wm {XPixie~
A pixie shimmering like platinum soars overhead
~
You see a pixie with a brilliant platinum gleam flutter nearby.  Looking over
this pixie, you judge that it is quite swift and strong, when compared to most
other pixies about the tree.  Its platinum arms and armor have been intricately
crafted by a master of craftsmanship.  Marvelous pixie runes are wrought about
the armor, and despite this pixie's apparent strength, it seems to be having a
hard time keeping flight wear all of its armor.

Entrance to the Canopy~
You find yourself ascending the trunk into the canopy of the tree.  Leafy
foliage is all about you, and it is hard to see anything at all in any
direction through all of the leaves.  Up above you, you can see hints of 
silver, gold, and platinum gleam above you, decorating the tree in a beautiful
manner.  Looking around, you see that it is possible to go any direction from
here.  Going up would lead you further up into the canopy.  Branches protrude
from the tree in all directions, north, south, east and west, while doing down
would take you back into the trunk of this magnificent tree.

You are up a small portion from the entrance returning to the trunk, which is
below you.  You are still quite low in the canopy of the tree.  Branches
protrude in all directions from here, and going up above you would take you
higher into the canopy.  Many silver, gold, and platinum gleams can be seen
above you, higher up in the canopy, but the silver seems to be closer now,
and there seems to be noble fairies all about you in the adjoining branches.

Top of the Canopy~
You are at the top of the canopy.  Above you can see the sky, and below you
are many, many branches, creating a dense foliage, making it hard to see down.
Looking far off, you can see the complete horizon, and many of the lesser trees

creating the top of the canopy, and you are able to climb out onto them in all
directions.  You are unable to climb any further up, as you are at the top of
the tree.  Climbing down would lead you back down into the canopy, and would
eventually lead you to the entrance to re-enter the trunk.

The Tip of the Southern-Facing Branch~
You're at the top of the tree on the tip of a south-facing branch.  Looking
up, you see the sky, which you feel you could almost reach up and touch.  All
about you on the branches on this top level of the canopy are glints of
platinum.  Looking down through the branches you can see silver and gold
gleaming through the leaves, and are able to spot a few bright balls of light
glowing far down the canopy.  Looking southward, you can see a gap or line
through the trees, which you guess to be the main road between Sanaria and
New Thalos.  Beyond the road, you distinguish a line of light fog, which must
be floating over the river.  From here, you are able to reach the tips of
branches west and east of you, or you can head back to the trunk following
this branch northward.

Limbs Between the Southeast and Southern Branches~
You are out on limbs between the southeast and southern branches.  Though
seemingly thin, these limbs are quite sturdy, and hold good.  Looking up, you
see the sky, which you feel you could almost reach up and touch.  All about you
on the branches on this top level of the canopy are glints of platinum. Looking
down through the branches you can see silver and gold gleaming through
the leaves, and are able to spot a few bright balls of light glowing far down
the canopy.  South and southeast of here, you can see a gap or line through
the trees, which you guess to be the main road between Sanaria and New Thalos.
Beyond the road, you distinguish what you guess to be a river. You are able to
climb to the tip of the southern branch west of you, or you can reach the
southeastern branch which is both east and north of you.

You're at the top of the tree on the tip of a southeast-facing branch.
Looking up, you see the sky, which you feel you could almost reach up and
touch.  All about you on the branches on this top level of the canopy are
glints of platinum.  Looking down through the branches you can see silver and
gold gleaming through the leaves, and are able to spot a few bright balls of
light glowing far down the canopy.  Looking eastward, you see many trees,
and beyond them hazed mountain tops stick up above the horizon.  South and
southeast of here, you can see a gap or line through the trees, which you guess
to be the main road between Sanaria and New Thalos.  Beyond the road, you
distinguish what you guess to be a river.  From here, you are  able to reach
the tips of branches north and west of you, or you can head back to the trunk
following this branch northwestward.

Limbs Between the Southeast and Eastern Branches~
You are out on limbs between the southeast and eastern branches.  Though
seemingly thin, these limbs are quite sturdy, and hold good.  Looking up, you
see the sky, which you feel you could almost reach up and touch.  All about you
on the branches on this top level of the canopy are glints of platinum. Looking
down through the branches you can see silver and gold gleaming through
the leaves, and are able to spot a few bright balls of light glowing far down
the canopy.  Looking eastward, you see a vast wilderness.  A range of mountains
loom beyond the wilderness, and almost due east you can spot a dale in the
mountains that surely must be Old Thalos. You are able to climb to the tip of
the eastern branch north of you, or you can reach the southeastern branch
which is both west and south of you.
