Desc A troll stands here.  An ordinary, nondescript troll.  His skin is
green, hairy, and covered in warts.  His limbs are long and lanky,
and his face is..well..let's not go there.  He has greenish eyes,
with blood-red pupils, and when he smiles you hear the faint thud of
nearby birds falling out of the sky.

Back Where to begin..  Kinral, as you probably know, is a Troll.  By
his very description, one would think him evil, or nasty.  However.. 
When he was just a small boy, he began showing interesting traits (I
know, i know..  What about a troll would be considered interesting?) 
As i was saying, a Troll would be considered interesting if he helped
to preserve life, not kill it.  Weird, huh?  From a very early age,
Kinral was considered a 'freak' because he would never play such
games as 'sqaush the squirrel' or 'mangle the mouse'.  He just didn't
fit in with the other trolls, he knew that much.  He felt alone a lot
of the time, and didn't have many friends.  While he respected life,
he didn't respect it to such an extent that he would preserve it at
all costs.  This is shown in how he dealt with the invaders of his
'town'.  They came, looking for a bunch of miscreant Trolls who were
terrorizing the town and killing local livestock.  Now, for Kinral,
this was all a way of life.  He never realized he was doing wrong,
but he did realize that the townspeople needn't be killed to further
their efforts.  Since he was considered a 'pacifist' by his fellow
trolls, he went to the town and tried to negotiate.  As he went, he
was ambushed by the men, seasoned warriors all.  Now, Kinral was no
wealking, but he was outnumbered and outmatched.  However, one of the
warriors realized the potential of the young one, and also the
kindness he showed, especially when one of the other warriors was
injured.  "He is different..  It is almost like he cares."  Thought
the man.  Seeing as how Kinral was almost dead, the mercenary told
his mean to go ahead and go on searching for the Trolls.  The warrior
offered to help Kinral out, but at first Kinral refused, saying that
the mercenary was an enemy, and he didn't want any sympathy from him.
The warrior tried to explain it to Kinral, but he wouldn't listen. 
Instead, Kinral attacked the warrior, and received a painful lesson
that day.  Seeing the superiority, Kinral figured, after 20 minutes
or so, that being asked to be an apprentice was just like he was
being taken prisoner.  Since there was no shame in being taken
prisoner, he agreed to let the man train him.  Sadly, while Kinral
was still learning to be a master swordsman, his master's area was
attacked by other mercenaries, because his master was thought to be a
'troll-lover', and everyone hated trolls, unless they weren't in
their right mind.  Unfortunately, Kinral's master died in an attempt
to keep Kinral alive.  Since Kinral's training was only half
finished, he set out on an adventure to gain the training needed to
complete what his master started.  Seeing Sanaria as being a place
where many races converged, he figured he could start out pretty well
from there.  Since then, he has been in a constant state of training,
and he has been honing his skills and body to become the perfect
fighting machine.
