Desc Standing before you some 6 inches off the ground is
the Dark Illithid Mabus.  His eyes pale as ivory with
no sign of pupils.  His skin is shrouded in his deep
purple cloak but from what you can see it is pale and
devoid of all sunlight.  9 some tentacles protrude from
his face and midway down his chest.  He makes no noise
and says nothing.  This kind of silence brings a dark chill
down your spine because you wonder if he doesnt speak because
of what hes seen or what he knows.
He stands at 6 feet and looks as though he is light as a
feather.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.
Growing up Mabus kept himself quite busy with his
studies for he knew it took time and knowledge to
become as great a magi as his father. With this
ambition Mabus took his knowledge to unheard of places
and set himself on a path like his fathers, then came
the dark times.  A human slave uprising brought war
upon the homeland and the deaths of many of Mabus's
family.  His father fought in the Magi Army against
the humans but fell in battle during an ambush on the camp.
After his fathers death Mabus was crushed...in the war he
lost everything he had loved and owned.  With his known
knowledge he departed his world and went to another with
all the books he could carry.  After this turning point
Mabus went to the dark arts of his abilities using his
magic for pain and suffering for all who oppose him.
From here he became a Necromancer and the only thing he
holds from his past if his memories.  Since that time though
he speaks very rarely.
