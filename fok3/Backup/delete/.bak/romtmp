Desc A tall figure stands in the dark.  As it steps out of the shadows
and pluges into the sun,you shape it to be a tall male elf of about
6"2' tall weighting approximetly 160 stones.  His face is long and
thin and variable scars appear on it yet he remains handsome.  His
ears: long and pointy.  He has dark blue eyes,the kind of eyes that
keep you dreaming in which you seem to fall forever.  His
nose:long,body.  On his forehead is a mark that seems to hold a
mysterious unknown background.  This elven male is wears a green
outfit from top to bottom.  His boots are solid and made of hard
brown leather.  His hands are covered by a pair of lightweight
durable elven gloves.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Legolas was born in Elvander,the home of the elves.  He is the
only son of a noble man named Tartanas.  He was given the name
Legolas as remebrace of the noble elven paladin of the past.  He was
a legend in Elvander and was highly regarded of.  At a young age,
Young Legolas dreamed of being as great as the Legendary Kii Master
Legolas but was not much informed of him.  Yet he trained hard
improving his skills and performace always comparing himself with the
Kii Master.  All that Young Legolas knew of Kii is that it was an
energy that he had in him.  As Young Legolas grew his curiosity grew
with him as well.  At the age of 17 he left his town and family
seeking wisdom across Thera.  He first destination was The Famous
City of Sanaria, a crowded city where he was sure he would find
something of the Kii master.  On his path,he stopped by Rivenrine to
rest...  There he encoutered a wise Warlock which told him of The
Tome of Age...  The book of the Kii Master Legolas,his final
dedication.  Young Legolas listened carefully to the wise words of
the Warlock as he mentioned the book was safely stored in the Great
Sanaria Library.  He left the following day heading east to Sanaria. 
At sunset he reached the Grand Gates of Sanaria and steped in.  Even
at this time of day,the city was crowded and loud.  He made his way
towards the Library of Sanaria and asked for the Tome of Age.  {c The
Tome was taken out...  {x he was told..  To his amazement.  Then the
cloud of questions formed...  Who?  Why?  Where?  He left to
Bradley's inn with these questions to reflect upon.  Legolas chose to
go to Bandell where Kii Master Legolas was buried, perhaps there he
could find something more.  Within a few days,he reached Bandell and
sat by the Kii Master's tomb and closed his eyes.  Immediatly he felt
something within him and feel into a deep sleep.  He steped into the
dream world...  There he met Luminaire Hanzaki who gave him his first
lessons regarding Kii - and a brief tale and History lesson of the
Fallen Order of Lurai.  Legolas fell deply in love and was touched by
the words of wisdom of the elf.  When he awoke,by Kii Master's
Legolas's tomb, he noticed another elf sitting not far of him staring
at the tomb of Luminaire Hanzaki.  Soon the elf stood and approached
Legolas and said to him that he is Hanzaki and seeks to be like the
Legendary Luminaire.  Legolas told him what he had experienced and
Hanzaki chose to join Legolas in his travels.  Then Came the
Mysterious Wanderer who revealed himself to be Elf-Lord Salindor and
gave his words of wisdom and passed on the Tome of Ages to Legolas. 
As the book was read and Legolas's training and mastering of Kii
improved the final steps for the Order of Lurai's rebirth were at
hand.
