Desc Before you is a medium sized creature which you cannot tell what
it is.  Its skin is hard and bark.  Its eyes, barely visible.  On his
or her body,you cannot determine nor are sure of it, is a suit made
of white mithril.  On its forehead is a scar long till its chin. 
Mysterious as this creature appears to be,it has an ovious structural
appearance.

Back Aye,the tales are known thoughtout the realms, Legends spoken and
songs composed of thee, the Women that has arised from a number of
exiled beings.  One that has united its race and brought freedom as
well.  One known as the Seeker, the Meditator, the Oracle, the Mind
Soul,Airia,daughter of a peasant.  Aye,you ask to know the tale... 
The tale of the {MV{mi{Ds{Wi{wo{Wn{Da{mr{My
P{mh{Di{Wlo{ws{Wop{Dh{me{Mr{x...  Then let it begin...  Airia was
born in the Sand of Sorrow where the exiled tribe of the Illithids
known as Avatars live; exiled for being different and strange... 
Airia was the daughter of a regular peasant and a maiden lady living
in miserable wealth and conditions.  Working hard day for the day. 
T'was a life of hell and as Airia grew, she realized that and did not
like it at all.  She once asked her mother why they had come to be
like that and her mother told her that once there people lived in
very fancy big houses and were very happy but they were exiled for
there people feared them...  Feared them for their mysterious
powers...  The capabily to manipulate the mind and thrust the cells
with this "Psychic Power" we have been gifted.  Her mother looked at
her then and asked her do you have this power?  Airia noded and said
that she had something of that sort but did not know for sure so her
mother took her into the empty wastelands to demonstrate what she
could do.  Airia glared at a bowlder and within fractions of a second
it blew up and only dust could be seen failing slowly on the ground
and being dragged partly by the wind.  Her mother was indeed very
impressed and placed her hands on her dauthers shoulder and said to
her in contempt :{cYour powers are amazing.  You have more psychic in
you than me and your father together.  Practice hard and bring
justice to our world my daugther.  {x Airia smiled and nodded to her
mother for Airia wanted Justice herself more than anything.  For many
years Airia practiced her Psychic Power in the wastelands from dawn
till dusk improving slowly as the days went on.  On her 17th
Birthday, she decided it was time for her to leave and begin her
journey in the realms of Thera.
