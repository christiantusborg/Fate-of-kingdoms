Desc Long flowing hair is probably the most obvious feature of this
elf.  It is controled slightly by a band of leather circling his head
at his temple, but one band of leather is just not nearly enough to
contain the flow.  Aside from that there is a strong set in his eyes
a look of determination.  His mouth is almost always set solid, in a
thin line, lips ill defined.  His face seems to be entirely without
humour.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  He was found on a
mountainside by monks as a baby, they took him into the monastry and
raised him in their ways.  He found the life of a monk to be very
rewarding, enjoying the solitude and contemplation.  However as he
grew older the urge to know about his parents grew stronger, it
started as a vague urge but grew to the point where it became obvious
that it would eventually consume him.  So he left the monastry to try
to discover about his parentage.  The first problem to confront him
was "where to look?"  The world is a large place and aside from the
fact that they were elves he knew nothing of his parents, his only
real hope was that while wandering the world guidance would come to
him as it had come to the monks of legend.  To date he has made no
progress in finding his family, but he has been only a few months out
of the monastry and his hope is still strong.  However in the past
few days he has been experiancing growing unease, perhaps nothing
more than homesickness but he has a nagging feeling that somewhere
something bad is waiting for him.
