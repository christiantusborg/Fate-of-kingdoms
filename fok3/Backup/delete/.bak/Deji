Desc Hovering before you is a small, male pixie.  He seems to be rather
impatient and darts back and forth.  His hair is wild and unkempt
While a little shorter than most pixies (standing at only 2 paces)
there is a wildness about him that is uncommon.  His light grey, 
almost silvery eyes continuously scan the area for no apparent
reason.  Deji appears to be a very fragile pixie, his smooth and
thing limbs moving gracefully as he mutters incoherantly under
his breath.

Back Little is known about this odd little pixie named Deji.  Very few people have heard
of his past.  Those who konw anything tell you that if you are really interested to
ask Deji himself, and be prepared to sort through a lot of rambling and incoherence.
when asked about where and what he has seen in his past, Deji seems to just stare off
into space, looking through you as if you were not there.  He then begins to ramble
underneath his breath.  It is hard to hear him at first, but it seems as if he is
speaking of his childhood.  Whips, shackles, beatings, and killing are al that are
coherent at first.  Then after a few moments it is obvious that he had been a slave to someone
or something.  He had been beaten unti lhis will had been broken.  Others around him
had been killed while he was forced to watch.  Then one day, a group came to his
master's home.  When they left, Deji was free.  With his master dead he began wandering
aimlessly going wherever his wings would take him.  He has met few people in
his travels and interacted with less.  While he has not yet made a name for
himself, he admits to having a driving goal to achieve some end.
As far as recent events of his life, Deji has been seen wandering around,
picking fights in bars and taverns with little or no provocation.  He also
has been seen associating more often with others, than he or his past has
eluded to.
