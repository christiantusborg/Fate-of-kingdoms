Desc Standing before you is a male drow.  He is very high, higher than
most drow, and he his weight is also higher than normal.  This drow
have got enormous muscles all over his body.  He has got short dark
blond hair and red eyes that glows in the dark, these eyes makes him
see very well in the dark.  When you first see Kamion somewhere, you
wont see him smiling alot.  He never smiles to people he never have
seen before.  This is because he want others to have the impression
of him as a very strong and dangerous drow.  Getting to know him
better you will see him smile alot more.  You will always see Kamion
using either a sword, dagger, spear or mace.  And he's deadly with
them all.  The rest of his equipment is shining, he always want to
look as best as possible.  Kamion is looking at you with a dangerous
look, you better turn around.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Kamion grew up in a town far far away.  Not yet known where.  He
grew up with an older brother, his mother and father who later run
away.  Well, rumours says Kamion and his family lived a happy life. 
In freedom and peace and just minded theire own business.  But other
rumours says this was not true.  It all started one rainy day in the
forest.  Kamion was 7 years old.  He and his brother were training
theire skills and spells in the forest.  When suddenly some drunk
forfathers came, better known as elves.  The elves walked up to
Kamion and his brother and started messing with them.  The Elves told
Kamion and his older brother alot of things that wasnt even true. 
His borther, Freiner started laughing at the elves, when one of elves
suddenly threw Freiner to the ground.  Freiner got angry, gathered
some dark spells and threw some lightningbolts at the elves.  One of
the elves ran towards Freiner and bashed him to the ground, and
stabbed him in his stomack.  Kamion hadnt learned so much spells yet,
so he didnt know what to do, so he ran behind a tree and hided.  From
the tree he could see his brother being stabbed and almost killed. 
But after a few minutes, the elves left with a grin on theire faces. 
And Kamion and Freiner went home.  Kamion scared, and Freiner hurt
and angry.  When they got home they told their parents about this. 
And his father yelled, ran to his room to get something.  Then ran
out the door.  After this, they didnt see him anymore.  No one knows
if he is still alive or if the elves killed him.  Kamion hates the
elves alot, and if you dare, you can see kamion in woods killing,
slaying, eating the elves.  And he still hunts them, kills them.
