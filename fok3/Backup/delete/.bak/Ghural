Desc Ghural is an average sized elf.  He is not very tall and
not very large, however his muscles are rather well
defined.  His hair is cut very short and it dulls out
the golden tint of his hair, to almost a copper.  His
eyes are a brilliant blue and seem to sparkle in the sun.
His skin is dirty, as if he hasnt bathed himself in some
time.  There are many nicks, cuts, and scrapes lining his
body that seem to be from some sort of thorn or thissle.
Underneath all the dirt and grime however is a supple, pale
skin.  The exact color is difficult to determine, but the best
guess would have to be a soft copper.  His skin does not look
normal for an elf, but it looks as if more of his time is spent
in the sun than those he keeps company with.

Back Ghural tells his story as if it is rather unimportant.  He
grew up in an elven village.  His parents were both mages,
and tried almost religiously to get him to study the magical
arts.  Ghural, however, was not interested in the paths of
his parents.  He would always dream of the outdoors and
imagine himself as a noble warrior, fighting off hordes of
trolls and orcs.  As he grew and began to understand more
of the workings of the world, he became fascinated with a
druid who gaurded a grove near his home.  Ghural began to
spend long hours with the druid, asking questions and
trying to learn everything he could about the land.  For
once, his parents were content.  He may not be studying 
their arts, but at least he is studying something.  One
evening after Ghural went back home from a days worth of
lessons, he saw the sky turn orange.  He knew that this
was not natural at this time of year, so he ran off to
see the old druid.  When he arrived, the shock nearly 
knocked him down.  The grove was on fire and the druid was
laying motionless in the middle of the torrent of flames.
He rushed unhesitantly to his mentor.  With his last breath
the druid told Ghural to protect the land.  The next
morning, Ghural told his parents good bye, took a sword, 
and began his journey to protect the land.  He would have
to be able to fight with weapons, since that failing had
robbed his mentor of his life.  He swore he would find a
balance between the blade and the land.  There his journey
begins.
