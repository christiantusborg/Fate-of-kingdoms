Desc Standing before you is a huge male ogre.  He stands around 35
hands tall and weighs approximately 200 stones.  Kuhl is hairy and
extremely foul-smelling.  His face is round, with deep bloodshot eyes
that glare around him constantly.  He has two large, prominent tatoos
on his arms.  These show lineage in the ogre, signifying the length
of time he has spent on Thera.  Kuhl's green is a dark, sickly green,
even darker than the skins of most Ogres.  He carries himself with a
confident air, as do most creatures of his size.  On his hip he has
small belt pouches hanging from his belt, as well as a large sword to
slay his enemies with.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of Kuhl and his history, all that I can tell you
are the rumors that are going around the local taverns.  Kuhl
supposedly comes from the very old Rangers clan, deep within the
forests.  He spent his childhood there, communing with the animals
and the forests, And also honing his skills as a ranger.  He learned
how to camouflage Himself, how to dodge, parry, block, and all the
other skills and abilities That are often necessary to survive in the
oft dangerous world of Thera.  Some believe that Kuhl came out of the
forests when it was savagely burned by an unknown group.  Kuhl had
been out hunting at the time, and came back to his beloved forests to
find only ashes, spirits, and the distinct odor of an ancient enemy. 
Since then, Kuhl has wandered the realms of Thera, searching for
those who had destroyed his verdant forests.  During his travels,
Kuhl has met many different people, some which were good, some bad. 
Many of these fellow travelers taught Kuhl important lessons and
useful skills, all of which Kuhl added to his repertoire.  He has
gathered information about the movements, whereabouts, strengths, and
weaknesses about his foes, and is now training to move on his enemy. 
And when he does finally go up against his mortal enemies, he will
show them the same mercy that they showed on his beloved forest.  In
Kuhl's travels, he has met many different travelers, beasts, and
Cunning enemies.  Several times in his battles he has faded out of
Existence, the victim of a slash to the neck or a crushing blow.  But
each time, the nature spirits Kuhl worships have brought him Back,
stronger and sturdier than ever before.  But each time, Kuhl Has
found that a piece of his spirit was missing.  And over the years And
long journeys, Kuhl has slowly become a cold, methodic killer Without
a conscience of any sort.
