Desc Appearing before you is a darnok of about 5 paces high.  Dangling
down are lock's all around his head but it's apparent that it's not
hair.  They appear to be somewhat like strands that are just
entension's of his head.  Eye's are large,oval and have a light white
glow in them.  Facial features are gaunt with a curious look.  Body
structure is medium,with webbed feet.  One thing that is visibly
noticeable about this darnok is that you see radiant light glowing
all about him,it's obvious that this being is something that's
divine.  Attached to his belt are potion's of all sort's that glow a
yellowish,white.  Also attached to his side is a mace,but no ordinary
mace.  It's light that radiates from it glows a bright white and
hum's making it's power known to all in the room.  Weyoun look's at
you and greet's you "Hello."  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Weyoun comes from a Valley deep in the far east of Thera.  The
valley of the Titan's.  Weyoun Grew up there all his life,and at the
young age of 4 year's old he started his priesthood in the healing
magic's.  His mentor was a very old,but wise and powerful Healer by
the name of Tyrin.  Tyrin moved from the city of the elves known as
"Elvander" to retire and hang his hat in the Valley of the Titan's. 
That's how Weyoun was so fortunate to train with him.  After year's
of vigorous training,in melee combat and the healing and protective
magic's.  Weyoun departed from The City of the Titan's.  To discover
new magic's,explore Thera and make companion's.  Weyoun is known to
be a character of good nature,regardless of his race.  His mentor has
worked with him long and hard to get rid of the natural evil that his
darnok mind possesses.
