Desc As a soldier of good, Karlenor is incredibly well-endowed.  His
muscles are much larger than an Elf should have, and he stands about
6 feet tall, adding a hint of superiority to his figure.  He wields a
lightly humming sword of elven make, keeping it at hand at all times.
His eyes are a light blue, complementing his slightly tanned skin
complexion.  His ears, in the normal Elven fashion, continue on out
to a point, and his high cheek bones and tight facial skin make him
look like his face was chiseled out of stone, and no smooth edges
were put in.  His hair, a golden color, flows down about a fourth of
his back, pulled back into a pony tail.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Karlenor is an interesting individual.  He has always been
interested in upholding the laws and protecting the innocent.  From
the time he was a child, he constantly aided the young and the
imprivileged, as he was considered one of the 'priveleged' in the
city of New Thalos, since his parents owned a rather prosperous
store.  From their store, they got all the money they needed, and
Karlenor was able to use it to help those who weren't able to help
themselves.  This behavior has been going on since a terrible event
happened to him.  He was just a child when it happened, and no one
could have guessed what effect it would have had on him.  Before he
was a kind individual, Karlenor was a mean little brat with no
respect for others.  He was going about his rounds, generally making
trouble with the dwarven children at the playground, and causing his
parents much grief.  Then one day, while he was out doing this, his
home was attacked.  His parents were always being blamed for his
actions, and finally someone was sent to deal with it.  This thief
was a master of his skill, and neither one of his parents, in all
their elven alertness, was able to detect him until too late.  The
thief had already stabbed both parents in the back by the time they
realized that something was up, and Karlenor walked into his house
just as the death blow was being dealt.  Watching the thief, Karlenor
realized that he could do nothing, and ran, far off, to cry.  He
returned after an hour or so, with his parents already taken from the
house.  He didn't know what to do, so he just went to the kitchen and
looked for some food.  He was able to sustain himself for some time,
due to the large stockpiles of food and other goods his parents had
left.  Not a day passed, however, that he didn't think about them. 
After about a year of this, when he was 14, a kind man found him
amidst the ruins of his home, where he offered to train Karlenor in
the ways of the Paladins.  When Karlenor refused, the man, who was
named Alexander, decided to keep his offer open, because he saw the
works of the Paladin god in Karlenor, things like Karlenor touching
wounds of children and them instantly healing, or his change in
attitude since the 'incident'.  Finally, after much time spent in
consideration, he accepted.  After three years, Karlenor had finally
learned all that Alexander had to offer, and continued his training
from there.  Since then, Karlenor has done many wonderful things and
has made quite a name for himself among the poorer populace of the
city of New Thalos.
