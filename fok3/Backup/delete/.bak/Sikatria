Back {wSiaktria is an Ogre female,born under the sign of the
{r"{Y<>{WA{wn{Wg{we{Wl{Y<>{r"{x.  She believe in no religion, except
herself.  She was born in Sanaria,a famous city very known in the
Realms Of Thera.  {D"Time to practise and train and be the most
powerful female warrior"{xShe said out loud and smiling to herself
she started to look for every city she evr heard of.  At first,she
found: *{cShire{x *{cOld Thalos {xAnd there she trained till she was
powerful enough to train and practise in the other cities she will
later find.  She was glad of her improvements and the gods even
started granting her titles like swordmistress,mistress of the brass.
The warrior the fenceress,etc...  All of them pretty and nice that
suited her perfectly.  So she ran and walked and sometimes fled. 
Other times she went kayaking or swimming or even flying!!!!!!  One
day,she met with a younf female creature called Elvira.  They became
frineds really fast.  When Sikatria found out that Elvira sold
potions and things like that,she asked her if she can give her some
of the potions.  Elvira didnt want to give her some of the
potions,(sikatria was really hurt and thought that elvira wasnt a
good friend,but later elvira explained to her why she couldnt give
them for free) Sikatria bought a very nice looking vial of {rLove{x
Potion,but she was afraid to try it.  Elvira wanted to show sikatria
how a good friend she was.  She told her that there was a job man in
Sanaria(the famous place where Sikatria was born) This job man guy
,if asked too,can give siaktria jobs and then he'll give her money! 
And he sometimes gave lots of Glory points!  Which were even better
than the money!  And so Sikatria started to work and train herself
with other creatures in the realms of thera.
