Back Before you is faustas once a noble cleric.
ho fell a terrrable fait due to insanity.
he led a normal child hood he played with freinds did his studys and loved his parents.
when he was 17 he decided to join the ranks o the clerics in his local town of tersu.
he was very wise in his studys but didint agree with some of there rules and it slowly ate at him.
his elders senced something wrong and so sent him on a spiritual journey.
he went up into the gortu mouantins near his town and meditated for what seemed days on end.
he had horrable visions of death and torment.
when he came down he his village had been burned to the ground.
seeking out the raiders he went north, and in finding there incapment he slautered them all and tourtured there leaders.
and it slowly drove him to insanity.
he began to see things in diferent lights and he was determined in his goals to the point of death.
he came upon a man in his travels who had similar views.
he was also once a cleric and told faustas of the group called inquisitors.
they were a band of clerics told to have been crazy but to themselves they were enlightened.
he joined a band of them whos coured the lands in search of others like them or to simply pleasure themselves in the delight of others pain.
for what seemed years he travelled and killed one after another till one day his party fell ill.
they slowly died and he was left alone
he then traveled alone spreading what he called 'the word'.
many thought him crazy and in need of help but he wouldint listen and kept on with the spreading.
he would sometimes develop followers who would travel with him for a small while then leave or go completly insane and kill themselves.
he always thought that what others called his insanity was actually enlightenment.
it angered him to no end when he was called mad or insane.
he would get into a fit of anger and rant at the person about there inferior being.
and on one of his journeys he came upon a church .
inside were a group of cleric priests going about there day.
he enjoyed the cermon and after wards began to speak to the clerics about the problem with there laws and how they could benifit from him.
when one of them politly said he should see the town doctor he got that look in his eye's.
before then he had had problems but they had tipped him over the edge.
trying to help him they cast spells and chants all around him.
with a thrust of a dagger here and there they all lie on the floor dead.
when the cermon for the next day came the doors were locked and people were angered because the priests had not been about for days which was abnormal for them.
a foul oder also eminated from the church and many were frightened.
the town waited for days on end until one day faustas emerged from the church with a smile across his face.
when the village people entered screems could be heard for miles , all the priests had been hung and words mocking there ethics had been carved into there faces.
it was too late though for faustas was too far away now for them to catch.
and his insane reign of spreading his word continued.
village after village city after city.
he purged what he called the misguided.
it wasent just clerics eaither he killed many a dark people.
on one such an occasion he had killed a blacknight when a noble paladin came to thank him .
the paladin had been almost killed and he had saved his life.
without a second thought faustas slit the mans throat and went on his way like nothing had happened.
all the while rambeling to himself incoherently about this and that .
like he was having some bizarre small argument with himself .
after months of traveling on his one man crusade he came upon a small village of priests.
he stayed in the village for a while and was calmed by it for an unknown reason.
he didint display his psycotic behavior and his ethics never came up nor did where he came from.
because he knew the ways of the clergy he was soon inducted into there priest hood.
and he was then given a large tattoo by some of the locals across his face that was written in old cratin which was the villages native language.
the writting speaks of a man torn between two parts of himself.
in essence being bi polar because he was still problematic at times with weird notions and his different color eyes gave him a very half sided look.
he was happy with his little querks and enjoyed his priest hood being apart of something again filled him with wonderfull thoughts.
but one night with th poor elfs luck a band of orc raiders came in and burned them all alive.
reminding him of his childhood he became visious and stur crazy again maming all of the orc's and tourturing those that survived his onslaught.
the head priest just barely alive told him why while in the town he was kept out of insanity it was the tattoo he was given it was purifyed ink brought from a high mouantin and blessed by there god of the clergy relion.
as long as he kept calm it would keep him in normalsy.
appauled they had tried to change him but in agony at his loss of freinds he set of again taking what little he could salvage from the cinders.
he was yet again as always in the end alone.
but now it was different he had the marking which helped him with his corruption.
he was filled with peace and at times he would get a little strange but for the most part unless angered he was fine.
