Immtitle Immortal~
Back Lady Iraquia was born in the land of the elves and got raised by
her royal parents.  She grew up in a huge palace and have been taught
many skills and spells by the mage of the castle.  Her shildhood and
the little princess always thought having adventures of her own. 
When she reached the age of seventeen,she decided to go where her
grandmother used to have all her adventures.  And thats how she found
herself traveling around and earning her living.  It wasnt as easy as
she thought it will be...  Many wanted her dead But she knew she
shoudnt give up.  Lady Iraquia reached an inn and decided to sleep
there.  The bright sun woke her up from a somewhat strange dream... 
She coudnt remmeber what it was...  A stallion..  A man...  A rose...
A crown..  She didnt know what the dream meant..  But she knew it
meant something..  Something forgotten maybe...  Shrugging she packed
her travelling bags and left the inn behind her.  She found herself
enjoying the sight,she who has never seen the outside world,has never
went out of the castle's walls.  Out of nowhere,mobs came and
attacked her and it was like a reflex...  She quickly killed the mob
that wished to hurt her...  Surprised and proud of herself,she
decided to continue her journey.  The road seemed strangely
familiar,but she didt remmeber when she had seen it.  Was it in
another life she couldnt remember?  When?  If so...  How did all this
happen and what was all those dreams that she kept dreaming about? 
And is that mark on her forehead related to it?  She didnt know .. 
But was determined to find out..  Somehow..  When she woke up,she
found herself in the void..  With fairies all around her. 
Suddenly,they dissapeared and new ones came older...  Then younger.. 
All of it was so confusing...  A throne was standing in front of her
looking so huge and powerful.  But she felt peaceful,like she has
been here before.  She tried to imagine who was the owner of this
throne.  A King..  Or a God?  Suddenly she head from nowhere .. 
Whispering "A God"..  The God Of Time and Wisdom.  And with this she
remembered.  It all came to her suddenly...  But how?  She was a
drow..  Now an elf..  She was older..  Now shes younger...  Maybe it
was the gods of thera's decision to do that...  She felt dizzy for a
minute and magicly she found herself back to where she was before. 
She knew know why was everything so familiar,why she had those
dreams.  Those dreams were dreams of her old adventures.  @ And that
mark was the mark of {Y-{R={GT{gim{Ge{R={Y-{x.  Although she wasnt
physically the same,she was convinced that she still had the same
powers and she did.  She still knew how to cast spells and steal and
the gods renamed her Iraquia ,Princess Of Time.  Her adventurers
became wilder..  It seemz as if the gods have made everything harder
than before,Or maybe its because she was new to this body and nature
,and didnt know how to control it as much.  Soon,she found that it
was her body but she grew accustomed to it and her powers were as
powerful as before...  If not more powerful.  Years later she met
with an elf named Legolas who wished to be called Strider to protect
the Order from the desert Prince Paladar.  She felt him calling her
She felt him calling her and grew curious to find out more about this
"{cKii{x" he always talked about.  She soon found out that is was a
sort of magical energy and the peaceful Order created by Legolas
practised this Energy.  She decided to join this Order which was
called Lurai after the master who had trained the Legendary Legolas. 
Legolas taught her everything theyre was to learn and so did
Luminaire Raelothin and the Kii Master Hanzaki.
