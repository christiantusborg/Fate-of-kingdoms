Desc Here stands a young felar smaller then average
at a height of four and a half paces and his light
frame seeming no more then a one hundred and ten
stones in weight. A very fragile yet dexterous build
for the creature. The once beautiful coat now a blanket
of scars and imperfections the golden color faded to that
of a dull and pale yellow or brown. His eyes once glowing
with that of a pale blue now burn with a restlessness and
unquenchable thirst. Once so gentle and carefree turned to
that of a wandering hunter alert and untrusting.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back The fate of all lives is that of death, the circle unending
and never breaking. Only stories and legends remain to tell
the tale of those who have cheated destiny of it's prize.
What if the stories were true, might the fear be forgotten 
and fade away? Thoughts and questions race through the mind
of a young Felar ruled by his fear of the end. So young with
so much time ahead yet the burden of death heavy upon his
shoulders. The fear growing each day as death takes a step
closer with each passing day. Every moment as if waking from
the neverending nightmare yet the opposite seems true waking
from the beautiful dream tossed into the hellish nightmare.
This was not so many years ago before he knew of death as he
had no fear no inhibitions or even of such a thing existing
until the day of the of elder's passing into the next world.
It was then the seed of doubt had been planted and the worry
of the end began. A simple nagging of the soul at first which
would soon grow to become the nightmare that is his life. Ten
years would pass before the journey began to find the escape
from this unyielding fate of death. The fear spurring the child
onward to be released and find the answers. Heading east to
the city of Sanaria in search of something elusive and unknown....
truth. Truth of Immortality and escape from the inevitable death
that waited in the shadows beckoning for him.
