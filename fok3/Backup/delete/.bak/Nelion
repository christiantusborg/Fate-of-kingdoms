Desc A pixie is here with a mischievious grin, but the eyes
show deep wisdom and intelligence.  He is about 3 paces tall
and weighs 55 stones.  His hair is a golden amber color and his eyes
are dark blue.  He looks physically weak but you sense that
there is probably a deeper strength within.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.
He used to live in the forest of pixies.
After awhile he developed a deep love of the forest
so he decided to do all in his power to protect it.
So he took up the path of the druid and started to defend
his beloved forests.  Then came the night of the storm.
An evil being brought down a giant storm on the land of Thera.
This storm also hit Nelion's forest, after this Nelion decided
to leave the forest and hunt down this evil creature to avenge his forest.
He wandered for years learning and growing wiser but never
obtaining his true goal, to find and destroy the being that
could care so little for the beutiful forest that it would
destroy it just because it was in the way. After many
years of travel he decided to beseach his old pixie friends for help
even though he had left to become a druid they helped him to hunt down the being
of destruction.  Not for their love of Nelion but because they
loved the forests and they wanted to protect them too.
Now with hundreds of pixies searching physically and magically for the
destroyer of the forest they eventually found it in the
City of Vrandivan the ancient city where evil was said to be born.
the pixies all grouped together to fight this evil and
with their combined strength of magic and skill they
destroyed the evil creature that had been brought to this world
on the night of the storm, and made Vrandivan a smoldering crater
in the ground in the battle for the life of the forest.
Now nelion travels the world getting stronger so that if
the forests are ever threatened again he can defend it
