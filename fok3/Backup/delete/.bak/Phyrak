Desc Strong and stout this ogre stand to be about 12 paces tall and
weigh around 600 stones.  His skin is a dark grey but is mostly
covered with scars, armor, and animal furs.  Pouches don his back,
holding the many items of mystical creatures or of just simple foods.
White hair streams out from under his helmet, as do dark red eyes. 
His weapon clanks against his side stretching about 6 paces long. 
His arms are the size of trees, giving his tremendous strength while
his rough leather skin serves as more armor.  On his wrists seem to
be a ancient kind of tattoo, perhaps an old war part symbol.  Or
maybe more complex.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  He was born to a rich
family of ogres (rich to their standards) they owned most of the land
in their village, and hunted many animals each day, yet their had
been a terrible tradgidy one day...  A band of rebellious magi was
spredding their corruption accrossed the land, literally, plaguing
everything in sight.  They were sweeping the land fast and brutal,
nearly at the mountainous villages in which the trolls and ogres
lived.  Warning came to late though...  They were over ran by
mystical creatures summoned by them.  The magi used these creatures
to ravage the lands of trolls and ogre, many were killed, they were
not prepared for this fight....  Phyrak's family moved farther up the
mountain to a mighty fort, built in a troll ogre peace treaty it
stood stronge, they were ready to hold of the magic users.  The
battle day came, the magi sent forth plaguing the lands, ogres and
trolls both charged the fields from behind the caster, removing the
heads from the bodies before they knew what had happend.  They then
used the hides as trophies, marks of war showing what had been done
that day.  After such a battle, Phyrak thought it was to set out on
his own.  He soon found his calling, a mighty HORDE, against magic
users as himself, he knew that he must join in this battle, to end
the corruption of magic acrossed Thera.  Horde had reign for but a
short time again, the rulers were corrupted and did not follow their
beliefs that they claimed to hold so true...  Many left the kingdom
before it crumbled, one of them being Phyrak, he wanted to end the
corrupted magicians lives, not the ones that strive to help..  F
Phyrak then decided the best way to help thera, is to join with a
newer kingdom, old teachings, very old guild, but in thera they were
newly known, they kept secret for many years, working only as
mercenaries.
