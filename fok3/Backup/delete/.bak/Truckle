Desc Before you is what is quite unmistakably a dwarf.  If such a thing
as a "big book of characatures" existed his picture would head the
chapter titled Dwarf.  In fact he looks so much like a dwarf all the
dwarves from back home used to make fun of him for it.  Basically he
has a big beard, a big nose a big belly and very short legs.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  Except by those that
know him.  And if asked about him they would probably very impolitely
tell you to go away.  However if you were to hint at the possibility
that their cooperation might conceivably be rewarded with a drink of
the alcoholic sort then they just may tell you the following....  He
is a dwarf!!!!  If you were to actually buy them a drink then they
might tell you the rest...  He is indeed, as appears, a dwarf. 
Rather unsurprisingly (to non dwarfs at least) he was born and raised
in a mountain.  As the 3rd son he was sent to the local barracks to
be trained as a guard.  He learnt quickly and well and thouroughly
enjoyed it all.  Sadly however whenever he was sent to guard anywhere
no one would take him seriously because he looked so Dwarfish. 
Infact not only would people not take him seriously they often
thought that he was actually a non-dwarf just pretending to be a
dwarf, and so a lot of offence was often taken.  This caused him to
see the world in a somewhat unusual way, finding it really quite
difficult to focus on anything of much importance for very long. 
Well one day while he was actually guarding something (nothing
importnat enough to be worth relating) he saw his first non-dwarf. 
Much to his surprise this non-dwarf (actually he found out it was a
human) didnt treat him any differently to the other guards, and so
after his injuries had healed Truckle set out to find more of these
strange tall folk.  After much searching (which wouldnt have taken so
long if the first few months hadnt been confined to the mountain)
Truckle came across a human, a paladin, and started following him. 
After a few weeks they had developed a friendship and the paladin
began to teach truckle his ways.  However all was not well, Truckle
began to annoy the paladin, they had a falling out and went their
seperate ways.  Truckle was by now though determined to continue to
learn to be a Paladin (or at least what he thought a paladin should
be)
