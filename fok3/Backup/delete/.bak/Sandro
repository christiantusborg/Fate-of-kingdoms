Desc Before you stands a human of great size, with broad arms and
shoulders.  His body is covered in colorful and well polished
equipment, with muscles showing from under the armor.  Beneath the
armor, on each arm, you see a tattoo glowing, a colorful tattoo with
a writing.  On his left arm there is a red tattoo, with the writing
of Honor on it, and on the right arm he has a blue tattoo, with the
writing of War on it.

Back Many legends and tales are told of this grand god, a holy Human
Paladin, representing the war in Thera, yet representing the honor in
most wars.  It has been told that Sandro, son of Yjaldimar, a strong
paladin warlord from ancient times, was born in the north eastern
parts of Thera, deep in the high mountains.  He was raised alone by
his loving father, who tought him of wisdom, strength, of all the
history of Thera, and most important of all, the honor of battle. 
One day, as Sandro was practicing his skills, he sensed a change of
breeze in the air, when suddenly his father walked into the room,
followed by a being of greatness, his eyes filled with wisdom and
power.  Immediatly Sandro recognized it to be Takeda, the greatest of
all Immortals, the greatest of all man in Thera.  Yjaldimar quickly
picked up his armor and weapons, hugged Sandro and entered a portal
made by Takeda, without saying a single word.  Puzzling thoughts went
through Sandro's mind, although he knew that his father had for sure
been asked by the great Takeda to aid him and the other Immortals in
the fight against the ruthless Elementals, who had caused much chaos
in Thera lately.  Many days had passed, yet Sandro had recieved no
word from his father.  Buried in worrys and dreadful thoughts, he
decided to walk out to the main city in the whole land of Thera,
Sanaria, for there he would find some information on his father's
whereabouts for sure.  Picking up his armor and weapons, he strolled
out to the city, trying to keep his mind clear of thoughts.  Arriving
at the eastern gate of Sanaria by nightfall, he quickly went to
Bradley's inn, to get a room for the night.  Watching drunk men mock
him, and scrawny old women stare and whisper at him, he rushed to his
room.  Weird he looked indeed, for he was a young man, at the age of
14, fully equiped with armor and weapons, like a true warrior.  He
slowly fell asleep with thoughts of his father, in a deep sleep,
which he did not leave until the bright sun entered his eyes the next
morning.  Shivering uncomftorbly, Sandro woke up and went back to the
entrance, to buy some big pot pies.  After eating a quick breakfast
he trotted to the center of the town, to have a chat with the
etherial being who stands by the fountain, who answers to the name
Malgad.  Malgad told him that his father indeed left to aid the
Immortals in the wars against the elementals, but hopefully will be
back at home soon, for the Immortals are overcoming the elementals. 
Leaving with a broad smile, Sandro gave Malgad some pieces of gold
for the delighting information, and slowly walked back to his home,
only to be stopped by a gush of winds on the way.  Suddenly, before
him, appeared a portal, and out of it stepped Takeda.  Looking behind
Takeda, Sandro hoped to see his father, yet the look on Takeda's face
immediatly told him what Takeda had come for.  A tear fell from
Sandro's eye.  "A honored death he died at least, your father. 
Yjaldimar was a very smart person, and his love to you was greater
than anything else, he wanted you to know that."  Said Takeda.  With
that Takeda entered the portal again, and Sandro caught a glimpse of
what was inside the portal, a battlefield filled with lifeless bodys,
and warriors fighting.  Years passed and Sandro grew older and
stronger, gaining much experiance along the way.  He knew then, since
the day Takeda informed him of his father's death, that he will serve
the immortals, and die an honorful death as his father did.  The war
of the elementals had passed, the Immortals had overcome the
elementals, and all was peace in Thera.  
 
 
Some say that Sandro had gotten too strong to be a mortal, some say
Takeda decided to take him as his own follower,
and some say he had just the right strength and smarts to serve as an Immortal.
Until this day, no one knows more about Sandro, the god of War and Honor.
