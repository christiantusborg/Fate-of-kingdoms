Desc A male human is here.  He stand a little over six feet tall, and
he appears to weigh around 160-170 pounds.  Kormien sa'Gorn has dark
black hair, but there are strains of white hair peppering his scalp,
especially at the temples.  His flesh appears to be pale and taught,
like a man old beyond his years.  Yet the eyes are a smouldering
grey, and they belie his aged appearance.  Though they are usually
impassive, those eyes can serve as a window into the firey soul of
this malevolent man.  Kormien's frame is tall and somewhat lanky, but
his muscles have a fighter's tone.

Back Kormien sa'Gorn.  Few names in the long history of this rock have
evoked more fear, hatred, aggression, jealousy, and anger than his. 
Once the co-leader of the demonarmies of Narssius, Kormien's life
took an unexpected turn with the sudden cataclysmic changes that
rocked Thera not too long back.  But that's another story.  The one
that'll be concentrated on here is the story of his early life. 
Kormien was born in a relatively small town, somewhere outside of
Marinburg.  In fact, it's not on most maps.  He was born unto a
simple family, his father was a merchant and his mother was a
home-maker.  As parents do, they tried to give little Kormien the
best of everything, but even at an early age he showed a rebellious
streak that hinted at darker actions in the future.  As he grew into
adolescence, Kormien became a real bully.  Not so much in the
directly violent sense, no.  Kormien preferred to manipulate his
classmates, and to use their fears to his advantage.  Of course, when
someone needed convinced, he would simply beat the hell out of them. 
But he had a quiet manner that scared most normal people senseless. 
Kormien also became very interested in the act of torture.  No animal
was safe to be left outside, and mothers feared he would try his new
"art" on their children next.  Finally, the town Elders convened with
Kormien's parents, and they agreed that the young man should be put
away.  That night, when they came to take him, they found Kormien had
gone.  He simply vanished, slipped out into the night.  Onward
Kormien ran, far to the north of his town.  He spent many nights in
the wild, cold, hungry, and wet.  It was during a particularly
violent storm that Kormien slipped in the mud, and fell for what
seemed like forever.  In a blinding flash of lightning, a small form
appeared to him.  It was a firey red imp, a lower planar denizen.  It
said nothing, but silently led the dazed young man through the woods
and to a ramshackle hut.  An aged man in dark robes opened the door,
and pulled Kormien in.  The old man thanked the dark gods for his
good fortune, and he raised Kormien from that day on out as his own
son.  The old man was a maligner, one of an ancient guild of mages
that practiced dark and unspeakable evils.  He had prayed for a new,
younger person to carry on his ideals, for he knew his time was up
soon.  He taught Kormien of the value and power of the dark paths,
and under the old maligner's guide Kormien even learned a fair bit of
swordwork.  But, time stands still for no man, and the old maligner
soon passed on.  On the night of his death, the maligner called young
Kormien into his room.  He passed on a fell blessing, and pointed to
a box at the corner of the room.  With that, the old man passed on. 
Kormien was awestuck as the old man disappeared before his eyes.  He
went to the corner and opened the box, and found enough gold to start
his life, a map to the Lordcity of Sanaria, and information the old
man had written out about the Black Knights, a fell and secretive
group of evil warriors.  Full of hatred and scorn at a world that had
deprived him of his only friend, Kormien set out for Sanaria.  He
trained under the Knights, and soon set out on his own.  His life
would take another turn, as he met up with the famous human warrior
Trythog.  The two formed a fast and lasting friendship, and Trythog
put Kormien's dark skills to use in his Demonclan of Narssius. 
Kormien rose in the ranks of Narssius, and soon acted as Trythog's
right hand.  All would change soon, however.  A great cataclysm came
to the world of Thera, shattering all perceptions and thoughts held
by it's inhabitants.  The coven of Narssius was shattered, along with
all other Theran nations.  Kormien has lost contact with his old
friends, and he continually seeks to find some normalcy in his life.
