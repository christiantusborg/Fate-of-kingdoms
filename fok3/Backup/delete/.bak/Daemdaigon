Desc A male Duergar.  He is short, solidly built, and dark of skin. 
His eyes dart about ceaselessly and he is constantly fidgeting with
his hands.  His arms and legs appear to be thin, yet he moves with a
fluid grace, despite his small stature.  Tangled hair covers his
body, and flows from his scalp like a torrid river.  Scabs, scars and
sores dot his exposed skin.  When he grins, it is quick, and his
teeth are broken, with several missing.  Finally, he smells terribly,
not so much that he doesn't wash, but more like he swims in garbage
and refuse, day in and day out.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Daemdaigon is a Duergar of the once mighty Stone Mole clan.  The
Stone Moles were a clan steeped in history and conflict.  Formed over
five hundred years ago, by Jorgund Blacktooth, "Dwarf Slayer", the
Stone Moles were known for their exceptionally violent tempers.  They
waged war upon all races, but mostly Dwarves and Duergar.  Named the
"Accursed" by the other Duergar clans, the Stone Moles survived
alone.  Not only survived, they thrived as outcasts.  For four
hundred years, the Stone Moles lived in a constant state of war. 
When no outside enemies were available, they battled amongst
themselves.  It is for this reason the Stone Moles never became a
truly significant power, no one powerful enough could ever unite the
entire clan, and those that tried, ended up dead before long, either
slain in a coup, or by members of his own, jealous family.  For four
hundred years they survived in anarchy....  Then came Jakandyr. 
Jakandyr was a warrior born.  He was ferocious, powerful, implacable.
He rose through the Stone Mole ranks faster than any before him.  At
the mere age of twenty-two he controlled half the resources of the
clan, through not so subtle intrigue, and military might.  He did not
defeat his enemies, he destroyed them, completely.  Under Jakandyr's
leadership, the Stone Mole Clan became united as one, a feat never
before recorded in Clan history.  Upon consolidating control of the
Stone Moles, Jakandyr began a vicious campaign against the other
races of the Underworld of Thera.  Capturing vast mineral deposits
from Dwarf and Duergar alike, he formed his clan into a very nearly
unstoppable force, vastly rich and immensly powerful.  It is at the
peak of Stone Mole power that Daemdaigon is born.  First and only son
of Jakandyr, he is the sole heir to his father's underground empire. 
From nearly the moment he is born, Daemdaigon is prepared and trained
for the responsibilities that lie ahead of him.  His first and in
fact, only memories, are of combat training, tactics and governing. 
A weapon at his side, and an eye for betrayal are all he knows.  At
only seven years of age he has three kills to his name, and the
constant warring with the other Duergar clans and the dwarves fill
his future with many more.  Brought up in the narrow passages of the
Underworld, he soon learns that there is neither room for forgiveness
nor pity.  It is kill or be killed.  Constantly berrated by his
father to be better, harder, harsher, he becomes bitter with his lot
in life.  Constantly hated by his fellow Duergar for his powerful
position, he is disgusted by his people.  But it is his only life and
all he knows.  Daemdaigon's life will soon change.....  One day
before becoming an "Adult", the Stone Moles are invaded.  Tired of
the depredations of Jakandyr and his clan, six of the other Duergar
clans join together in an alliance.  They invade the Stone Mole's
holdings by the thousands.  Jakandyr himself leads the defenses.  For
three days the battle rages in the tight confines of the Underworld. 
Near the end of the third day it seems the Stone Moles, through hardy
defense and incredible grit, might indeed hold off the allied clans. 
But it is not to be.  While attempting to ambush the enemy commanders
camp, Jakandyr himself is caught and surrounded away from support
from his clan.  With only a small bodyguard to protect him, they
manage to hold off a force ten times their number.  In the end
Jakandyr falls, and with him, the Mighty Stone Mole clan....  When
Daemdaigon hears of his father's death, the decision is quick. 
Taking his few belongings, he leaves the Under-World forever, fleeing
to the surface to find his own destiny.  But Daemdaigon can never
forget his past, his training, and his father.  He knows truely in
his heart, that as long as he breathes air, he will be a Stone
Mole.....
