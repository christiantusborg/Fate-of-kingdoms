Back Rillifane Rallathil (rill-ih-fane rall-uh-thihl) is quiet, reflective,
and enduring over eons unchanged. He is the least flighty in the
Elven Pantheon, the last likely to act on a whim, and often grave and
self-absorbed. The Leaf Lord is protector of the woodlands and
guardian of the harmony of nature. He is often linked by his clerics
to a giant oak tree, so huge that its roots mingle with the roots
of every other plant in the world. The great tree draws into
itself the ebb and flow of seasons and lives within the woodlands
of the green Elves. At the same time it, defends and sustains those
lands against disease, predation, and assults of all kinds.
The Leaf Lord is the patron of good rangers and druids
(especially Elven Rangers and Druids). The church of the
Leaf Lord generally keeps to itself, extending itself only to help
fellow elves and other sylvan beings. The church hierarchy is
organised regionally and divided into branches, as each type of
cleric serves a specific role. The druids who compose the bulk
of Rillifane's clergy tend to the health of the forests and those
who dwell within, fiercly contesting any atempt to further reduce
those forests that remain. Many clerics serves as ambassadors of
the faith, working outside the communities of the Forest Elves
to educate other races how to to better dwell in harmony with
nature. Rillifane's clerics are deadly enemies to those who
hunt for sport or those who harm trees maliciously or
unnecessarily. Rillifane's clergy is charged with rooting out
and destroying sentinent plants whose nature has been twisted
by external forces into a warped perversion of nature.
Elves who seek a form of spiritual rebirth or a major change
in their lives gather to celebrate Rillifane's eternal promise
that the trees will bloom again and that life is a process of
continual renewal.
 
DOGMA:
The Great Oak draws energy from all living creatures of the world
and nourishes, sustains, and protects them from outside threaths.
Live in harmony with the natural world, allowing each living be
the opportunity to serve out its natural purpose in life. As the
Leaf Lord's countless branches, his faithful are to serve as his
mortal agents in the natural world: Defend the great forests from
those who would ravage their riches, leaving only destruction in
their path. Contest both the quick and the slow death of
Rillifane's bounty and hold strong like the great oaks in the
face of those who can see only their own immediate needs.
