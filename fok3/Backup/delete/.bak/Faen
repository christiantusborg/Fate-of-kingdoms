Desc A moderately build felar stands before you.
Standing nearly seven feet in height he appears
to walk gracefully, yet with a small hint of waryness
to it.  His red eyes are unusual for someone like him.
His face resembles that of a black panther, sleek and
shining with the small amount of light that touches it.
His hands are like that of his ancestory, clawlike and
deadly, even without assistance from a weapon.  His head
constantly turns left and right, scanning all the faces
about him.  His eyes darting from one person to the next
in a wary manner.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Born in a felar tribe of the plains, this male kept mostly to himself.
He accepted the fact he was not like the others, only good at anything
that required him to be alone, and silent.  His tribesmen knew this, but
they were a proud people, and would not bend their ways to fit in one
that was not able to conform to their ways.  All they could do was treat
him as one of their own, and leave him be when they needed to find food
for the rest of the tribe.  The disappearance of Stormyr had the tribe in
a panic, search parties were formed daily to find the missing leader of
their hunting parties.  After several days, Faen was asked to go out on
his own and find them.  Perhaps the silent treading he could do would
be an advantage for him, would let him carefully get closer to the cause
of Stormyr's disappearance, without letting whatever it was, Faen was coming.
The tribe was right. Faen, after several days travel, had spotted a man
carrying Stormyr away unconsious.  Carefully, Faen stalked his prey, waiting
for the right moment to strike the man down so he could bring Stormyr
home where he belonged.  After half a day of carefully stalking the man,
the figure gave Faen his chance.  The man had stopped at an encampment
other figures were training in the distance.  Darkness would soon come
he would enter the building the man went into at night and get him by
suprise.  He found a quiet spot a fair distance from the camp and soon
fell asleep, his travels used alot more of his energy than he thought
he had used.  As he woke he found it the middle of the night, it was
time to continue.  Carefully he made his way through the camp avoiding
being spotted.  The late night trainers had not seen him...luckily.
As he approached the building, however, he suddenly felt an arm wrap
As he approached the building, however, he suddenly felt an arm wrap
about his neck,  moments later he was lying unconsious on the floor.
As he woke he found Stormyr next to him unconsious, he couldn't tell
why, the great hunters body was covered in bruises, lashes, and every
other type of mark possible.  Wether he was beaten unconsious or sleeping
you would never know from just looking at him.
