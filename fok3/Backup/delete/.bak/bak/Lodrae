Desc {x Standing before you is an ancient warrior of some of the oldest
times from the length of the days.  From time to time history as do
heros seem to repeat themselves, however this one does not.  This
shrouded figure that stands a full stature of six feet tall with a
great muscular form.  Upon their mysterious thin and toned face was a
maskwhich resembles a upper half of a skull with glowing eyes and a
thin form along his high cheeks and pointy chins.  The outline of the
mask attains a deep blue that also resembles the cowl cloth.  Upon
the mask and face are marked with swirled black and red verticle
marks that strike through the eyesdown though mid-cheek and cutting
through thin long red eyebrows.  A reverse veil and bandana cover
that head of long deep crimson locks of hair and half helmet, where
many leather straps and buckle straps around his head.  Underneath
his mask, long and pointy furry tan feline ears are hidden.  His
cheekbones are raised high upon his face on that otherwise undefined
mask.  A pointy nostrol-less thin nose sets in the center of the The
similarly visardstays shrouded in dark underneath the hood ofhis dark
cloak and cape, only two glowing eyes seen throughwith three points,
also glowing in a upside-down triangle, glowing a genuine sanguine. 
Raised up around his stiff and muscular neck, wrapped with two
leather straps and a tight deep material was a collar to the cloa,
which set a deep dull gray with a faint ragged trimming, which
allowed even less light to penetrate the hood.  Wrapped around
massive and broad muscular shoulders was a very broad pair of a light
weight metallic shoulder pads.  A set of whiteish gray dragons teeth
lined right above the bottem edge of the silver trimmings,stained
with blood, the teeth of a demon or a dragon.  Grand and massive arms
sprout from those shoulder-padscovered with multiple plates of light
but thick armor until reaching a spiked elbow pad, vorpal spikes
pointing towards the bicepts.  Underneath the armorwas visable a pair
of bandanas that reached around his thick arms, which flickered in
the wind.  A set of very heavy gauntlets aligned the forearms and
donned nimble hands with polished claws and knuckles on each and
every finger.  As each finger oftenly move, not a single squeek came
from the metallic gloves on his fingers.  Down their masculine chest
was a chest plate and an abdomen plate which followed every conture
of their chest and abdomen.  Three sets of heavyleather belts were
tied around their thin girth, very slender in size.  Each Belt
containing a string of pouches, holes for weapons and clothes that
held sheathes for weapons of unmentionable horror.  Beneath those
heavy buckleswere the sleek and slender muscular legs and a round
keen bottom.  Scarce armor was tied to their thighs other-wise the
giant tied belts held up a pair of militant style baggy knickerbocker
pants which were old and ragged over the many years of wear and tear.
Those militant pants were slightly diry from years of sandy years and
miserable weather.  Further from the 'spring loaded' knees were thick
metal boots made of leather and heavy metal trimmings.  Generous
shingaurds protected his shinsand shoes on the boots to protect his
agile feet.  Hidden far beneath any armor was that tail, kept
hiddenthough still adding extra balance to this canned beast.  Not
many have been able to catch glimpse of anything beneath that exotic
armor to set veiw upon tanned skin nor admire any bravely earned
battle wounds.  Only long ravaging and a fiery of long wild crimson
hair was ever seen besides the dull dull metallic tone of this
ancient warrior.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back {x From the names of many, Lodryri Kar-Zeloth, noone knows for
sure.  Time is a strenuous and never-lasting thing.  A normal
creature, born upon the foreign terra firma.  An innocent soul once
cast from those lands, venturing out upon the worldall other pasts
wence a century long and forgotten.  And eradicated from all memories
that have forever been long lost.  The begining is only the start
ofanother sad ending, where this start, training begins underneath
the youthful squirehood of great Titans of War, Kingdom generals and
captains who graciously took their time.  The tradgedies of war took
their mighty toll upon the great generals for whom have the highest
priority, and the lands.  Times were drastically changing and the
district was crumbling, it was time to move on towards the unexpected
twist of his own worthy advesary.  Quiet and distant from the rest,
Lodryri spent times training upon the North Articlands, and the
barren desert lands, training upon a perpetual view of golden hills. 
Wicked and jealous corrupt gods watched in protest of any attempt of
gaining strength, so giving a conflicting vex of contreversey,against
the Eastern Goddess arose the high winds of the Far East.  Combining
the winds from a typhoon and the stinging sands of the desert caused
an ennui of fatigue and agony, thus sweeping him from the lands. 
Striken from the mortal planeand soul was held before the decisions
of the divine council of all existance.  Death consumed all life, the
fires of the deserteradicating all existance of the body, leaving
only the soul to a miserable descent through a hell that could only
be created by gods to torture the innocent.  A tormenting two
centuries pass,all old and legends dying offand reseting to the
younger and weaker generation, trying to make fame in a harsh world. 
From what seemed like endless death came light, a few centuries spent
in eternal damnnationworse than anything imaginable to the mortal's
mind, any pain sensed from a human,were mere specks of sand in the
desert of suffering.  One sheer momentwhich would never seemto come
from this infinity of everlasting torture, came to a cooling touch, a
relaxing second that Lodryri has ever felt , The feeling of no pain
was the best pleasure ever imagined.  The Lord of all gods, High
Immortal Kazmir, with the young Salindor a bard from olde, once saved
from by the horrors of the anti-gondorians.  In a dark space, Lodryri
slowly arose from the darkness of the void, a soft blue nurturing and
murmuring lightcame from the sky, slowly arising the dark from the
ground, giving him another chance.  Also, arising from the sand, a
singled naked figure, still the same as they were, preserved from a
day of training.  Returningto the green lands which so many were
familiar to, The Kingdom Mordukhan rejected Lodryri from abandonment
and having succumbed to the immortal interface for the last
centuries.  He was now lost, and simply unguided, now left in the
cold.  Moving back to the deserts of lankford now ruins, for decades
resided, slowly effected by age, slower than the rest, learning
thatthe price of ressurection by Kazmir.  Death still consumed,
butstrong spirits revived the body,keeping it strong and mobile.  Now
training in that exotic city, creating new and different weapons. 
New strange skills, and discovered powers, were trained in a city
turned ruins, destruction was no loss.  From afar the crashing and
collapsing of buildings were heard by the Gondorian-Leader, who took
control over the true king's Absence, secretively asking Lodryri for
assistanceand new companionship.  Even with the help of the Ancient
warrior, Gondor was a weak kingdom, which then the over-aggressive
Aldon heat hunters hunted Lodryri night and day, so to prevent war
with gondor, Lodryri had no other choice but to leave gondor during
their epic war with the Mordukhan Armies.  Lodryri was undoubtibly
growing older, and things to do seemed to be getting old also, not
growing any younger, they needed something to doand planfor the
future seemed like a wise tactic.  Taking businessthe career of
trading, pawning, and the selling while slowly growing hatred and
hatefilled, filled with the greedy powers of Kazmir.  Attempted and
plans of destruction with the exotic plots of warand siege upon the
lands, cities being destroyed and demolished, civilization was slowly
being obliterated in the shadows of Lodryri.  Alas, with each new
comming citybecame newer and stronger and more aware defences, all
cities joining to end the man siegeand almost mortally wounding
Lodryri.  Hiding away in a bloody mess,thoughts of weakness
tremulated through minds, having in need of a larger army to
fightbattles, possibly demons or worse.  The mysterious man Lodryri
disapeared without battle or blood, many years later A seemingly
heavily clothed man, Lodrae rejoyce at calm and silence.  Though
still the power of Kazmir is unskirmishing, having a wide and vast
limitless source of powers, giving ability to give raise to the Five
Senmaruwarriors,Akamaruzu of armies upon the raise and fall of
constant cycles of contreversial and "predictable" kingdoms.  The
lands torn by warand the new uprise of callow and mediocre would not
survive in the world for sure,only thine power survives.
