Desc There comes a man wearing a Shining Dark Armor with two long
spikes on each side of his shoulders.  Ashram have long flowing cape
flying down his back revealing the color of darkness.  He wears a
long shining Blade with a thine black line that runs through the
middle of his blade.  Ashram have silky Silver hair with golden
streeks running through it.  His eyes are the color of icy blue with
a ring of fire red surrounding his pupils.  Ashram have sharp face
and looks very handsom for even a Felar.  He's taller then normal
Felars and is about 5 feet 8 inch tall.  You can tell that this felar
is a mix.  He seems like a half Felar and half Elf.  For he have
sharp face with big almond eyes.  There runs a cross scar on his left
cheek.  He have a dragon fighting a phoniex tattoo on his back with a
golden sun.  Ashram is truly one of a kind felar warrior.  You will
not see any other felars such as him.  He's very good looking and
charming but yet he looks very strong and fast and sharp.  He's one
guy you should not mess with.

Back Ashram's Mother was an Elf who fell in love with a felar male. 
Ashram father Damos was an warrior who was a knight of this small
kingdom far away from the main lands of Thera.  Damos was the captain
of the guards in the small kingdom.  He was very skilled with his
blade and everyone admired his skills.  Ashram was trained by his
father since the age of 4.  Damos was very proud of his son and
wanted Ashram to be the best there is.  Ashram was very skilled in
the art of Sword play by the age of 9 and many even said he would be
much stronger then his father.  One day the small kingdom went to war
with the near by kingdom.  Ashram was 14 by then and was in charge of
a small band of warriors.  Ashram stood there as hundreds of Warriors
left the castle to do battle.  All together the small kingdom of
Takkis had 500 warriors and 100 knights.  They fought an invading
kingdom which was stronger and older.  The war was bloody.  But after
many long months of fighting the Takkis warriors returned defeated. 
Only 150 warriors and 25 knights returned.  Then the enemy kingdom
attacked the castle itself.  Damos led his troops to defend the
castle.  Ashram was given the charge of guarding the streets of
Takkis with his small troops that number no more then 25 warriors. 
The battle took forever.  The enemy troops that numbers more then
1000 out numbered the small Takkis army.  Soon the castle walls were
breached.  The enemy poured in and attacked.  Damos charged forward
with 100 brave guards behind him.  Swords clashed, Axes chopped. 
Shields were cleaved.  Damos took out about 5 enemy warriors within
the first round of the fight.  The enemy stood their grounds fearing
his blade.  Out of the 100 Takkis warriors only 75 lived after the
first round.  Then came the second charge.  They fought brave and
hard.  But this time only 25 Takkis warriors remained leaving Damos
and 25 Knights.  The last fight was long fought.  But at the end
Ashram saw his father along with 10 knights charged at the enemy. 
Ashram screamed out as his father was covered by the rageing storm.
