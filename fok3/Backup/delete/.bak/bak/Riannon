Desc Riannon has a round face with very distinguished sharp cheek
bones.  Sockets that have very large eyes which have captured the
color of the deepest blue ocean water.  Long full eye lashes
surrounds the sparkling bright eyes.  A petite little nose slopes
downward from the glimmering eyes.  Tight puckered soothing full lips
so delicately filled with the lucious color of deep red.  Riannon has
broad shoulders contain a muscular build with perfect posture.  Hung
down the mid of her back is long flowing hair.  Hair so shinny there
is a shimmering glimpse of sunshine that brightens the already
blonde.  From the waist down there are smooth shinny scales ever so
green.  The merman has a large widely spread fin at the bottom of her
body.  The extremely curved body has a graceful yet carefree demeanor
that goes along with all it's beauty.

Back If you were to ask around the town of Sanaria about the traveler
known as Riannon you would hear an amazing story.  It has been said
that she comes from the land far away, but nobody really knows for
sure where it is.  Riannon was said to have been left on her own at a
very young age.  It was a Tragic moment in her life.  Her parents
lived in the town of New Thalos together in a cottage.  Until the day
when Narssius and Gondor went to war.  Riannon's father was a high
rank demon worhsipper for the mighty kingdom of Narssius.  While at
war Riannon's mother ran away, scared for Her life.  She ended Up at
a sea shore, hungry and cold.  While sitting there crying, she met a
man that was extremely nice and comforting to her.  When Riannon's
mother returned to Thera she found the Sad news that her husband had
died in a battle.  She gathered up the few things she had left
getting ready to leave, but before she left she gave birth to young
Riannon.  She left her to fend for herself.  An old man found her and
took care of her till she was old enough to go out on her own.  So
she set off to find a place to stay.  On her travels she met many
people and began stealing from others to survive.  She found that
stealing solved her problems.  It provided her with the things she
had to have to life, food, water, equipment and other things.  Until
one day when she came across a great man named Conrad.  He showed her
the true meaning of life.  So settling in Sanaria she began to get to
know all the people.  They accepted her for who she really was.  Then
one day a man named Kazmir came to her.  People say that he saw
something in her, a greatness, that others didn't see.  He showed her
the error of her ways.  Kazmir gave her the greatest gift,
Immortality.  Where she used all that she had learnt in her travels
to help others, guide them through there tough times.  That is why
she became who she is today.  A free spirited soul that believes in
order and justice.  It is said that the reason that she seeked vision
from the demons was to reveal who and why her father had died.  That
is why she now is apart of the Narssius Kingdom.  Demon Lord Trythog
knows of her unfortunate mishap and let's the demons run free with
her to help her on her ultimate quest to find The murder of her
father.  All the people speak highly of Riannon, even Gondor doesn't
hold a grudge against her for Her quest.  They have no idea who the
great fighter that Slayed her father was.  She knows that her father
died for a good reason and she knows that it was during a time of
war.  There isn't any disrespect from Riannon towards Gondor, she
Just wants to know who killed her father so that she can be at peace
with them and see if there was any final words that her Father may
have had.  The people on the streets have started stirring rumors
about her father and his death.  Riannon was very upset with all the
people saying these things.  It has been said that Gondor had plotted
for many years the death of her father.  It's said that they wanted
him dead for a long time that her father's plan to take over the
area's that Gondor controlled and they had planned to take action to
get rid of him.  Riannon didn't know what to believe she was
confusied and scared.  Since the fall of Narssius Riannon has
realized something that she never seen before.  She realized that all
the searching she had done to find her father has made her the great
goddess that she is today.  With that Riannon has came to peace with
herself about her fathers death.  She completely puts all her energy
into justice and order.  Those that have chosen to follower her are
following one of the greatest and true leaders of today when it comes
to justice.  Riannon has stared evil in the eye and defeated it.
