Desc Before you stands a troll that is not nearly as menacing, or
fearsome as most trolls.  In fact he looks rather peacefull, well as
peacefull as a troll could be.  Standing 4.  5 paces high with a deep
red skin which looks more like scales then skin.  In typical troll
fashion he has large powerfull limbs with rather unkept claws at the
tips of his fingers.  His yellow eyes posses slightly more movement
and thought then most trolls, which is maybe why he's not as
fearsome.  His bald head is covered with various tattos and insignia
that look rather beastlike, and violent.  With the rest of his head
having a sloped, slow kind of appearance.  Although he may not look
as scary, thier's a good chance that he could do some serious damage
if pissed off.

Back Coming from the deserted wasteland, trythog has certainly seen his
fair share of hard times.  With skant food and water his tactics have
won him fame for cruealty and efficiency.  This is how he became
known to thera.  While starting out with a small tribe of trolls,
near the lankfrod ruins, trythog was quickly expected to pull his
share, or be the next meal.  So you could say he was born killing. 
While still young his skills at killing, as well as organizing the
hunt where recognized.  Quickly gaining higher social rank within the
tribe, life was looking up.  However many of the other trolls whree
not pleased that such a young one would be so revered.  They didn't
plot or think, they just kicked his butt.  Gave him a whomping so bad
that trythog just left the tribe.  His pride as well as body injured,
he started to wander aimlessly through thera.  Killing and eating
more or less when he wanted and life was good.  It was during this
time that trythog found was to find out a little bit more about
himself and the ways of the world.  While walking through the emerald
forest trythog foun what ended up being Yun Fei Yang.  Naturually a
troll in the woods is not something one likes to investigate closer,
howver Yun Yang, is not you typical man either.  He motioned for
trythog to follow, and brought him to his simple hom within the
forest.  Thier he merely staired at trythog for a time, and then went
to sleep.  Trythog wondered how anyone could go to sleep with him
nearby?  This was really all it took.  Trythog could not understand
why anyone did not fear him, and hwo he could just sleep with him
right by.  So trythog started thinking about that ,and it eventually
led to other topics
