Desc Standing before you is a slenderly built merma of average height. 
Her long black hair is so shiny it seems to absorb all light around
it and radiate it back; In perfect comparison to her jet black hair,
her skin is the color of newly fallen snow.  Her large almond shaped
eyes wich are the color of the bluest sea and the greenest ocean are
fringed with thick long black lashes.  Her full red lips are curved
into an almost seductive smile and you find yourself smiling back. 
She seems to have an aura of {Cp{ce{Wa{cc{Ce and
{bS{ce{Br{Cen{Bi{ct{by all around her and you you feel relaxed just
being in the same room as her...

Immtitle Immortal~
Back A long time ago in a hidden forest, a young merma went into labor
all alone with no one to help her.  In utter agony, she fell
unconscious and woke up to the sound of a baby crying.  Someone had
helped her give birth...  She looked around her to find the person
but there was no one to be seen.  Suddenly she focused on her baby,
it was a beautiful baby girl with the most stunning eyes.  Holding
her seemed to calm the young mother and she died peacefully with her
baby in her arms...  17 years later...  A teenage merma by the name
of kassandria roams the forest looking as if she knows it like the
back of her hand After asking around, we learned that it was the
forest animal that helped kassandria's mother give birth Kassandria
is very much a loner.  She keeps to herself and only interacts with
the creatures of the forest.  You can tell they love her very much. 
She was raised by them and learned the secrets of nature and the
forest.  She is a very tranquil person, very much in touch with the
spirits of the forest She rarely leaves the forest except for every
couple of weeks when she goes to town to get some supplies.  Looking
at her, you would think that shes very much at peace with her soul
but when u look into her eyes, you see the pain of losing her mother
reflected upon the surface Deep down, she longs to find her father so
he can tell her what her mother was like.  All she wants is to feel
like she knew her and thats what keeps her going every day the hope
of finding her father...
