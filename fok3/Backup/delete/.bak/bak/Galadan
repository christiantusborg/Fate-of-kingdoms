Desc Before you stands the disheveled figure of an orc male.  He
stands at perhaps 6 heads in height, and is quite a thin wiry example
of his race.  A thick moptop of silvery green hair sits atop his
head, and large inteligent eyes peer our from under the tangled
locks.  He is garbed in the tunic, breeches and cape of a nobleman,
but the cloth is tattered and worn.  Holes at his knees and stains
all about his tunic give him the look of a beggar, but he carries
himself with confidence.  The orc has quite a strange air about him..
He is far too handsome by orcish standards..  And his eyes display
more than the average vacant stare...

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  In the last Age...  An
ancient Defiler who had survived the two ages upon the lands of Thera
began to grow to old for even his magic to sustain him.  He had
journeyed threw time and accross lands, meddled in the affairs of the
powerful and shaped the world gradualy to his liking.  But though he
was able to stall the hand of time by magic and reincarnation to new
bodies, his time was approaching.  Though there was chaos within the
realm, and ripe chance for manipulations of his favorite sort, the
old knight of darkness ignored the affairs of the world.  Hidden in
his secret subterranean lair, he toiled day and night for years in an
attempt to discover an ultimate magic that would grant him the time
he needed.  And then one day, he did..  From a most unlikely
source...  Over the years, the knight had begun to take apprentices
to assisst him with his research.  The assistants never did last too
long..  But for one.  A human female..  Eager to learn and full of
youth and love...  He, a grizzled old veteran of the many ages, felt
his heart melt in her presence.  Over the course of they're work
together..  Amazingly the dark knight began to truly learn the
meaning of love..  In the fall of winter one dark night, the two were
married.  Two years later, on the night of the birth of they're
child, the ancient black knight died, with his son in his arms.  That
child was named Galadan, after his father.
