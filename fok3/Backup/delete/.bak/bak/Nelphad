Desc This human is of average appearance, height, build..  In fact, he
is just plain average.  He does have one interesting thing about him.
His hair is green.  Yes, green.  His eyes are green as well. 
Strange, as most people do not have green hair.  Suddenly he d oesn't
seem so average any more.  His skin is a faint brown color, most
likely from a tan, but it is hard to tell.  He has a greenish tint to
everything about him though, and this is odd in most ordinary people.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Only a few people know of Nelphad, and only about half of that
number can say they are his friend.  Nelphad is a Ranger, whose
history routine patrol duty around his keep.  Most days it is just
for show and to keep the local populace in check.  Unfortunately,
recently Trolls have been encroaching upon the keep's territory. 
Anyways, he was following his set path, when he came upon a minor
patrol party of the enemy.  Withing moments, three quarters of the
trolls were dead, and the rest were running.  He pulled out his bow,
and finished the last couple off.  Unfortunately, this was only a
small patrol group out of thousands.  What is Nelphad's part in this?
Well, he was sworn to protect the lands around the keep, and he has
been finding more and more signs of death and destruction, coupled
with mutilated, half-eaten corpses.  Unfortunately, Trolls are the
only ones who could possibly commit such atrocities.  And again
unfortunately, Trolls just happen to be the hardest woodland raiders
to kill.  Continuing his patrol, he found another enemy patrol, which
he quickly dispatched.  When he went to report back to the keep, he
was shocked to find a partial siege under way.  The Trolls, it seems,
were surrounding the keep.  Fortunately for the humans, this was only
a fraction of their major force.  Unfortunately, this was a force set
out to determine the amount of Trolls it would take to gain control
of the keep, then raze it for supplies.  Nelphad, previously stated,
comes back to find his keep under siege, so he stays out of it. 
Intercepting the messengers, Nelphad learns what the plan of attack
really is.  Seeing this as their only chance, he quickly runs back to
the base to get in.  As it turns out, there was no way into the keep
without letting out the secret of their entrances.  Thinking quickly,
he gains the essence of the animals around him, allowing him to
pretty much jump over the walls.  After he makes his report, he goes
back to defend the keep, and the only home he has ever known. 
Needless to say, the trolls were badly beaten.  Then the main battle
ensued.  Nelphad had enlisted the aid of whatever Rangers were in the
surrounding wilds, bolstering the keep's defences greatly.  Sadly,
this was to prove to not be enough.  The main force of one thousand
Trolls, minus one hundred, marched down the path.  The Rangers
surprised them with traps and other deadly weapons, cutting down
around fifty enemy soldiers.  As they came within reach, the
defenders rained wave after wave of arrows down on the trolls.  Those
that were not immediately killed regenerated their lost blood/body
parts.  The keep was in for a long battle.  The seige lasted nearly a
week, but near the fourth day the main gates were finally breached. 
By this time the three hundred defenders were cut down by half,
whereas the Trolls were cut in half as well, bring the count to one
hundred fifty versus four hundred twenty-five.  The battle commenced
inside the keep's inner ground, but the Trolls were stronger, and the
odds were still about three to one, so the humans, now down to a
force of twenty rangers and thirty footmen, made their last stand
inside the keep itself.  The two hundred remaining Trolls charged
heedlessly on, meeting the spears of the defenders.  The speartips
themselves were heated to an almost unbearable level, preventing the
trolls from healing their wounds.  However, as the Trolls continued
their pressing charge through the keep, the Humans and Rangers were
getting beaten at every turn.  In the last showdown at the top of the
keep, five Rangers killed the twenty remaining Trolls.  However, the
price they paid for victory showed.  Only two footmen survived the
initial raid, and one died before the last Ranger could get to him. 
The footman and the Ranger made their way out of the keep, and set
fire to the horrible tomb of their enemies.  Nelphad and Cargen, the
Ranger leader and Footman leader, were the only two to survive. 
Cargen and Nelphad eventually split ways, Cargen going north, Nelphad
south.  The two never met again.  Eventually Nelphad made his way to
Sanaria, but Cargen was lost to time, as was the keep and the
horrendous battle that took place.
