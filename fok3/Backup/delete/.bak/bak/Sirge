Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  This young felar was
born and raised on the streets of Sanaria.  At the age of three he
lost both of his parents and he was forced to live with his abusive
uncle.  It didn't take him long to run away from home.  He fled to
New Thalos hoping to find refuge from his mad uncle.  He soon met a
group of young thieves.  At first the thieves planned on kidnapping
him but once they saw how hopeless and miserable the young felar was
they befriended him.  He lived with the thieves for a few months
until he was found once again by his uncle.  His friends that were
told about the constant pain and suffering Sirge had to face because
of his uncle, decided to hire an assassin to get rid of the pest. 
The hired hitman assassinated Sirges uncle quickly and silently.  The
young felar was amazed, he couldn't belive a man could kill someone
so quickly and get away with it.  He began to spend time with the
assassin, who's name was Hierro.  Hierro, who saw how ambitious Sirge
was, decided to train the felar in the arts of war.  Sirge passed a
few years under the supervision of his new mentor Hierro.  He
mastered all the skills he was taught and it didn't take him too long
to surpass his own master.  It was then that he received his first
task, to assassinate the Thain who lived in the shire.  Sirge quickly
finished his task, at this moment he realized that he had great
potential and that he could easily become one of the greatest
fighters on Thera.
