Desc He stand about 5'11" fairly tall for his race, his eyes are a deep
dark green color.  He wears a amulet of a strange symbol around his
neck and dons dark robes worshipping the god of evil.  Leather boots
are tied with strong bonds half way up his shins and gold spiral
bracers wrap around his wrists, his skin is a pure black, blending in
mostly with his robes and the shadows.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  He was born in a
demension very different from Thera, there, time passed quickly, when
minutes passed in Thera, months passed in his home demension.  This
gave his people a technilogical advantage over other demensions, they
would advance through years of technology while places such as thera
would have gone on but a week of labor.  His parents were murdered in
the Githyanki rebellion, the humans had ran from their slavers and
into our village, we were not warriors there, nor were we capable of
defending ourselves, we used our mental capabilities in farming and
technologies, not fighting, my village was out numbered greatly... 
They slaughted all but a few, i had been one of the unfortunite few..
I was captured and taking to a human prison.  We were starved and
tortured, even though i had been only nearly 8 at the time, thank the
god i had been born very advance in Illithid mentallity, i planned an
escape, but not without slaughtering these humans for what they did
to my parents.  A human entered my cell, ready to continue my
torturing, but insted i focused on his thoughts, acuired his mind and
forced him to unleash me.  Upon relasing me i slayed the fool,
raising his body as a servant, such magics we unknown to us still,
how had i been able to harness it?  Not worrying about it at the
moment, i sent forth the skeletal warrior to release my friends. 
Then the slaughter begain...  We made way through the prison,
releasing all the Illithid prisoners.  The Githyanki stood no chance
at this point, guards sounded horns, mean (men even) ran in fear as
my skeletal warriors made passage after passage through the prison to
the main chambers.  The doors to the chamber flew acrossed the room
as my servants rage was unleashed, the human leader behind coward
into a corner as we entered, he begged for mercy, but that he did not
get, for what they had done to my village, he was to be made an
exampl The doors to the chamber flew acrossed the room as my servants
rage was unleashed, the human leader behind coward into a corner as
we entered, he begged for mercy, but that he did not get, for what
they had done to my village.  He was to be made an example of for the
rest of the humans.  `.  F For killing my village he was strung up in
the Illithid Capital City.  Here he was stoned, flogged, then his
entrails ripped slowly from his body, all the while Illithid priests
kept him alive to feel all the pain.  His final punishment, he was
set aflame by the townspeople, his screams echoing through the
streets as the smell of his flesh filled the air, the order for the
priests to stop the rituals ended the filthy humans life.
