Desc Standing at about 5'11", muscular build for a felar yet very
slender.  Doning dark green robes with a leather tunic under it
covering a white shirt.  He wears no shoes as to let his clawed feet
stick out.  His face is quite featureless, merely covered by fur, his
eyes are a deep dark red.  His hair is very short, most likely a
felar trait for cleanliness.  He holds a strang staff in his hand
with markings that are unkown.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  What is known is that
this felar is part of a very rare path taken by the people of Thera,
so rare that there are few left today.  Quistile was born in the
Forest of Thera outside of Elvendar.  His family had been outcasted
from the city for there race, forced to live off the land as their
ancestors had once did.  Luckily his mother stumbled acrossed a
village of nomads, felars, elven, humans, all living in this village.
The village welcomed her and she lived there for many years, falling
in love with one of the felar villagers, Quistile was then born.  As
he grew up he was taught to defend himself, his father was a skilled
warrior, but war tactics alone did not amaze this younge felar, he
also dabbled in the arts of magic, he found curiousity in the magical
things that he could create.  The elder of the village discovered how
the boy was teaching himself well and took him under their wing, the
had him train in a long forgotten art.  The village Shaman worked
with him, teaching him the ways of the Shaman.  He learned many
things, but what greatly caught his attention was that he could learn
to create and control beasts, such as the tiger and wolf.  For many
years Quistile trained with the Shaman, hoping to one day be the best
of his kind and to bring forth many other to train as Shamans.  His
quest first started in Sanaria, where he moved to upon his 17th
birthday.  He went into town to buy supplies but still liked the
outdoors to make camp and sleep at.  He hired help to build a kind of
fort just north east of Sanaria, setting it up with both hard labor
and magi defenses, he then used it for his teaching grounds, taking
in those who wished to train in his art.  He then made one last trip
into Sanaria, buying enough supplies for years and then posting a
scroll up on the town board, promoting his school for Shaman.  For a
while few thought much of it, but eventually people came, wishing to
learn of the many pros of being a shaman, yet some only found the
cons.
