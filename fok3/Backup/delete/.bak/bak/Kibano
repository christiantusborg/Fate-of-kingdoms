Desc {x Kibano is a enourmas man standing a tall stature of six foot
and seven inches of a bulging figure of muscle.  His is trimmed
solidly with a grand build with a lightly tanned skin, covered with
light ammounts of light hairs.  His hair is long and green, combed
down from the center and swept to each side of the head, long that
hangs down off his head and above his shoulders.  Along his chin is
more thick hair in a short beard and mustache along his chisled chin.
His long deep black with green tainted hair covers his ears.  Thick
dark eyebrows are aligned above those small black eyes, always
looking forward while keeping constant awareness all around him.  A
thick neck leads down to a set of massive shoulders and a barrel
rimmed chest which are connected to titanic arms, bulging freakishly
with muscles.  His thick wrists are connected to large hands, covered
with small scars and a few tattoos over his overhand, ready to snap
for each of his blows.  A set of wooden bead bracelets wrap along his
wrists, each strung and painted with black kanji symbols as of one
wrapped along his neck.  He usually wears a white gi shirt and
another unformal shirt underneath.  Along his built legs are a pair
of white pants each with a black and blue spiked patterned designed
along those cotton garments.  Over his giant form is another robe
that fits losely around his remarkable form of masculinity and
strength.  A sash of the similar black and blue stripes line across
his shoulder through his waist, also tied with a thick black obi belt
that wraps around his Haori and pants.  Upon those large used feet
are a pair of sandles he wears to travel across the land and possibly
even fight with.  Across his fine specimen are a few jagged scars
down his body and one across his cheek, showing his aphorism of
battle.  This man is well traveled, having an odor of none and sound
of deep and silent night which he speaks with thin and very slightly
mobile lips.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back {x There is not much known about a younger background to this
strange man, only known he was born in a small town to the East of
Thera.  A dark little village filled with many people and buildings,
He was born in a small teac hosue off the busy little dirt roads that
lead to that city, always enjoying a trip to the slightly distant
training hall that was not far off from the forest.  Knowing from a
trained master of Five martial arts, lethal or not, Kibano spent his
time to train them.  When Kibano was learned in those ways of martial
arts within the village of various and vast trained warriors he left
the town to explore Thera.  Having explored alone for many years he
traveled from hall to hall, learning new arts of martial ways of
fighting and battles.  Having converged all of styles into oneunique
always laerning, now traveling with new companions Wykstra the Pixie
Mage and Romos the Duergar Knight.  They now travel across the lands,
Kibanos reasons for cast off from the side of his others.
