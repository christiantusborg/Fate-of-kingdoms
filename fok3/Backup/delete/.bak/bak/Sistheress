Desc You see a tall and slender figure.  Upon further examination, you can
distinguish cat-like features, hinting the fact that it is a felar that
stands before you.  Looking at his face, you determine the felar to be
a male.  His eyes are squinted, with a{bdeep blue{Bglow.  Fur covers
his cheeks, sloping over a ridge to his mouth.  His face is masked with
a {yrusty{B coat of fur, growing darker at the tip of his pointy ears.
You would guess this Felar to stand about six paces tall, and weighing
one hundred and thirty stones.  The coat covering his body is {rmaroon{B
fur, dusted with specks of {yrust{B.  Though possessing a medium build,
this felar is quite slender, and very agile.  As most felars, this one
carries himself very gracefully and is very alert, a bit more so than 
most Felars.  A strange symbol, perhaps a birthmark, graces his left wrist.

Back Asking around in Thera, one will find it hard to hear any tale of the 
early days of Sistheress.  In New Thalos, though, there is much to be
learnt of Sistheress.  For that is the place of his birth.
 
On a cold night, late in the winter, many, many winters ago, a young
felar was born.  His mother, a weak, but fair felar, and his father, a
lean, but strong felar were outcasts of their tribe.  The reasons for
their being outcast has never been known.  It is often thought and said,
however, that it was because they were often disobedient, having no
respect to their matriarch.  Sistheress's mother was known in New
Thalos as Siberessa, and his father as Sisthero.  His parents would
often visit an orc, at the New Thalos inn, in the hopes of getting a
meal, often fasting, so that their dear Sistheress could eat.  In
exchange, Siberessa would clean the inn and serve... often being
mistreated by the travellers, and often being abused by the orc.
 
One evening, when Sistheress had yet to see his seventh winter, his
mother and father went to the inn starving.  They left Sistheress in a 
corner of the alley cold and starving, covered only in their raggedy
cloaks.  Waiting for his parents' return, Sistheress's hunger began to
overwhelm him.  Staggering down the alley towards the market square,
Sistheress spotted a small creature crouched near a window, trying to
keep warm.  Lunging at the animal, Sistheress realized it was a small,
feline.  Despite his hunger, Sistheress could not bring himself to harm
the creature, and staggered on to the inn in search of his parents.
 
Meanwhile, at the Inn, Siberessa and Sisthero were working hard for
their food.  Siberella, after serving a meal to a shady traveler, turned
to return to the kitchen, starving and ready to return to her dear
Sistheress. As she walked away, the shady traveler asked her to help
him with something in his room.  Ready to leave, she hurried up to
complete whatever task he needed help with.  When they entered the room,
the traveler locked the door behind him, and threw Siberessa to the
floor.  Siberessa screamed for Sisthero loudly, and attempted to escape
the grasp of her attacker.  Forcing the traveler off her, it was then
apparent that this traveler was a Felar thief.  Running for the door,
she attempted to turn the knob, only to see that it was locked.  A
hand then grabbed her by the shoulder, and flung her against the wall,
rendering her unconscious.  It was at this point that Sisthero kicked
the door down, and with the knife he had been using to slice meat with,
stabbed the thief in the shoulder, and threw him aside.  Clutching his
wife in his arms, the orc entered the room, along with three royal
guards, their hands on their weapons.
 
The thief yelled, "Argh!  She tried to distract me!  While her husband
stole my gold!  I caught him though!  And she stabbed me!  She stabbed
me!"  Siberessa began to come to, and tried to stand up, only to stagger
and fall back to the floor, where the dagger was.  The guards then
pulled their swords from their sheath, and turned to Siberessa.
Siberessa, trying to push herself up, laid her hand upon the dagger.
It was then the thief began to scream once more, trying to catch
the attention of the woman he just attacked.  Siberessa, still dazed,
and unknowingly with her hand on the dagger, looked up at the thief.
One of the guards, then raised his sword to strike down Siberessa.  Her
husband, seeing his wife's peril, then lunged at the guard.  The orc
reacted to Sisthero's lunge, and held him to the wall.  The guard's
blow fell, hindering any life left in the already injured Siberessa.
Sisthero, in his wrath, pushed the orc, releasing himself from the orc's
hold.  Grabbing a candlestick standing near him, Sisthero struck the orc
in the eye, and charged at the guard that dealt the fatal blow to his
wife.  Jumping at the guard, Sisthero while mid-air, kicked the guard
in the head, sending him to the floor.  Landing over the guard's body,
Sisthero grabbed the dagger on the floor, and sliced the guard's neck.
It was then, that two blows struck Sisthero.  One on his side, and one
through his neck.
 
The guards, hearing another scream, turned just in time to see a young
felar, running from the hallway.
 
It was that day, the orc running the New Thalos Inn obtained the nickname
Patch.  It was also that day, so long ago, that Sisthero vowed to
avenge his parents, with the very dagger that his father avenged his
mother with.  Sistheress one day will destroy every guard and thief in
New Thalos, along with Patch the orc.
 
Without his parents to protect the young Sistheress, the other beggars
soon began to bully Sistheress around.  Sistheress went to the palace,
to plead with the king for help, but the king would not even see the
poor child.  Sistheress, left completely on his own, was soon overcome
by the stronger and older inhabitants of the alley.  Soon the two cloaks
his parents gave him were stolen.  As things worsened, Sistheress was
more often starved, then not, and when he was able to find a meal, it
was often taken by the other alley dwellers.  The bones thrown at him,
as if he were a dog.
 
Sistheress, having taken far too much grief, fled the city, in search of
something new.
 
Sistheress was then not even seven years old yet.  Leaving the city, he
departed westward, and southward, before turning back towards the
rising sun.  While wandering aimlessly, Sistheress often found his mind
