Desc A Huge Demonic Dragon Whos Eyes Are Red As Fire.  This Vile
Creature Is Surrounded By Nightmares Seeking Rest From Their Eternal
Suffering.  Screams Echo At Night And Fallen Angels Ravage The Land
When He Is Near.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Long Before Humans Eve Existed, Gods, Angels And Fairies Lived
Together In Harmony.  There Was Peace Everywhere And Everyone Was
Happy..  And So They Thought.  Little Did They Know That Demons And
Fallen Angels Were Planning To Ravage Their Lands And Take Over Their
World.  Suddenly The Sky Turned Black And All Demons Came Out.  Lead
By The Vile Demon Obithius, They Killed Everything That Stood Between
Them And Victory.  It Seemed As If The Demons Where Going To Win But
Right Before They Attacked The Gods Last Fortress, The Gods Created
The Race Of Men Lead By Tarsalus.  With This New Ally, The Gods Drove
The Demons Back To The Pits Of Hell That Spawned Them.  A Place That
No God Dares To Enter...  But Men Could Almost All Demons Were Slain
And There Was A Fierce Battle Between Tarsalus And Obithius.  Since
They Were In Hell, Obithius Had The Upper Hand And Tarsalus Was
Loosing.  Knowing That He Will Die, Tarsalus Sacrificed Himself To
Kill The Demon And Save The World.  After The Death Of Their Leader,
Men Became Greedy And Lusted For Power.  That Lust Brought Upon Us A
New War, Men Versus Gods.  Men Enslaved The Fairies And Used Their
Power Against The Gods.  Since The Gods Were Still Recovering From
The Last War, They Did Not Stand A Chance And Were Easily Defeated. 
Since Then Men Ruled The World Witout Having Any Threats From The
Gods That Were Banished Neither From The Enslaved Fairies.  But Now,
Something That Rarely Happens Happened...  Reincarnation.  The Vile
Demon Obithius Has Been Reincarnated And Seeks To Avenge His Death. 
Since Reincarnation Does Not Reincarnate Him With His Full Power,
He's Now Secretly Training And Raising An Army To Attack His Enemy...
