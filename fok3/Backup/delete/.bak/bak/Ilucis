Desc Ilucis is a small draconian, perhaps three and a half to four cubit
tall. Unusually small for his race, he's also quite thin and lithe, and
if his eyes weren't the colour of a freshwater spring high in the mountains -
that is, deeply, striking blue, then one would swear that Ilucis is an
albino. His small, neatly patterned and tightly woven scales give him more
of a serpentine rather than dragon-like appearance, and are blue-white in
colour, with crossing patterns of darker blue scales. The small scales are,
however, not the only thing that gives Ilucis a serpentine appearance; so too
does the shape of his head, which is triangular and viper like, as it rises
fluidly from his shoulders. If it weren't for the wings, which catch the
light with every movement - dispersing light, one would easily be able to
mistake him for a snakeman of some kind, rather than a draconian. However, his
build, though slight, betrays him, and the definite bone and muscle structure
of his arms and especially his hands, thin and clawed as they are, are definately
those of a draconian.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Like many Draconians, Ilucis is from a large cluster of islands in Thera's
southern seas, on which, for the past few decades, many Draconians, due to their
density in numbers, have been abdicating their nomadic ways in favor of
semi-agricultural communities, based in large part on other societies that the
Draconians had observed.
 Ilucis himself was born into a family of landowners in the main city of Dracis.
Dracis, the first city so organized by the draconians, is by far the largest, and
is almost metropolitan in comparison with the other surrounding communities, and
even so compared to many of the other cities of Thera.
 Ilucis was shunned by many at birth, due to his unique appearance. He was (and
continues to be) smaller than any of his race, and considerably more serpent
like in build. The most glaring difference, however, was his albino colouring.
Though shunned because of his differences, Ilucis was not ostracized, due to the
influence of his family.
 From a young age, Ilucis also exhibited rare talents, and spoke occaisonally of
being told things by individuals who weren't physically present, or seemingly
nonexistant. Usually, these messages were simple but accurate predictions of the
near future; who had come to the door, for example. Or the face of an unturned
card. The result of this was that, in one more way, Ilucis became a sort of a
spectacle. As he aged, however, these messages became more detailed, and more
precise. Eventually, he began to recieve transissions, and around this point, stopped
talking about the voices he heard. Around this time, as well, a group of Illithid
and Drow scholars and mystics, about 12 in count, took notice of Ilucis' talents, and
approached him. They were assembling a great Library of Dracis, afforded shelter
and protection by the Draconians, through which they would also do their work. They
were about 12 in number. They provided Ilucis with literature and exercises to
enhance his natural psychic abilities, and also began to record the transmissions
which sometimes filled entire document.
 For years, Ilucis studied with the group, and developed psionic abilities to a
high degree. As he learned of his own remarkable psionic abilities, the group
devised methods by which one could obtain similar abilities, and recorded those into
a single volume, from which they all developed their skill.
 One specific night, while sleeping in his room at the Library, Ilucis recieved a
peculiar transmission in the form of a cacophany of noise, through which enchanting
music could be heard, and a voice urging him to go to Thera's main continant to
perform a task.
 In the morning, Ilucis told the group about the transmission, and retained a perfect
recollection of the music he heard, which could only be repeated by a 13 part group
of individuals. They learned and repeated the song over a two week period, during
which each night Ilucis was insructed to go to the mainland of Thera.
 Finally, when they were ready, they all sat down to perform. Surely enough, they
made a great and awful cacophany, which hurt the ears to behold. However, from it
a sweet music came forth, and then an image of four men, each on a throne, and one
elevated above the rest. The content of their message remains in a text in the
library, but is hidden, and shown to no one.
 Later that day, Ilucis set out to the mainland. A link formed between all 13 members
of the group at the library had been formed over the years, and so telepathic
communication was easily established.
 Since this time, Ilucis has wandered Thera, studying, developing his strengths, and
awaiting furthur information about the task at hand.
