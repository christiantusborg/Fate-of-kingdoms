Desc Before you stands a small male pixie cleric, 2-3 feet tall He has
a majestical aura surrounding him, and seems to glow.  He is clad in
elven armor, and wears a dark helm upon his head.  He is obviously a
great healer, and appears very strong.  His eyes are dark brown, and
he has long, flowing brown hair.  In his right hand, he holds a large
mace.  In his left, a shield with the symbol of his hometown, New
Thalos.  On his back is a pair of small wings, which are moving
quickly, causing him to hover about a foot off the ground.  Finally,
in his hands he carries a medicine bag, filled with many potions and
scrolls of healing.

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  Herus was born out of
the cracks of Mt.  Doom, after all was destroyed.  He became a great
healer among all, and also a great teacher.  He learned through his
experiences and through nature, the ways of the wilderness and the
ways of spellcasting.  In his early life, he was befriended by the
ogre sinosudial, and the dwarf jorlak.  Together they helped
eachother in many ways background he now spends much of his time in
the new thalos are, looking for new challenges to grow and learn even
more.  Once, during an adventure, he was fighting a dwarf warrior. 
He hit it, and it hit him back.  He was nearly dead, when out of
nowhere, a mystical warrior appeared.  He uttered the word to a
spell, and poof, the dwarf was gond.  Ever since then, herus has had
an undeniable connection with the divine.  Say he regularly worships
and prays, hoping that someday, he will be saved again He often
spends time now, learning from the great healers in elvander and
gondor.  He is learning to cast more powerful spells, and brew
healing potions.  On one occasion, on a trip to elvander, he found
himself in the ruins of a house.  He saw a large boulder on the floor
and decided to see what was under it.  As he rolled away the boulder,
he found that there was a hole with a ladder leading down it.  He
climbed down the ladder and found himself in a dark tunnel.  There,
sitting in the corner near much trash and rats, was a dirty elvish
bum.  The bum begged for money and Herus gave him 10 gold.  Then for
no reason, the bum gave to Herus and elven heirloom which look to be
of great power.  Now Herus wears it proudly, knowing it must be of
power to him.  Soon, Herus had become a very powerful healer, and
learned many things.  He was crowned master healer of Thalos by the
god Dermos.  The master healer travels now to many places, healing
and teaching.
