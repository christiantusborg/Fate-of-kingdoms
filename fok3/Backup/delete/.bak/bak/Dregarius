Desc Orange hair covers this Felar's body, black stripes running across his
entire length. Large cat ears cover the top of his head. Large blue eyes
seemed attached at the very beginning of his muzzle, his mouth only
distinguished by two pairs of fangs, one on top, one on the bottom, as
well as a set of whiskers on each side of his muzzle. His arms are
covered in scars, running around his arms in a circular motion, all the
way down them. He seems somewhat lean, only the barest hint of muscles
showing through his fur on his arms, and legs.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Long before he ever took up the name of Dregarius, he had been
raised in a tribe of Felar who had lived in the plains.  He had been
given the name Stormyr for his first actions in the world he had been
born to.  During his birth it had been a stormy night, and as he had
been put into a basket, instead of crying like a normal child, he
instead looked up, listening to the storm, and growled.  As he grew,
his fierce manner became his trademark, Savage killings, and even
more savage feeding.  At his tenth birthday, he was to be elected as
the head hunter, when a human came into the village.  While the human
was allowed, for they did occasional trading, this cerimony was
tradition, and only felars were allowed to it.  Stormyr found the man
walking the village, and with his usual cocky attitude, came towards
the man.  You man not enter the village, there is a cerimony going
on, now leave!  He told the man.  "How rude of such a small Felar to
be talking to me in such a way."  Was the man's reply.  Angered by
the remark, Stormyr came towards the man, intent on reprimanding him
for such a rude statement to him, before he could, however, the man
swiftly and gracefully tripped him, and caught him by the neck,
strangling him.  Before he lost conciousness, the man spoke to him,
"You'll be a perfect student, young felar, just be glad that I chose
you, and not another that would waste such talents."  After a several
day trip, the man disappeared into a training encampment for
Assassins.  Several of the students who trained there remarked later
that for a week, their sleeping time was interrupted by howling, and
cursing in a language none of them really knew.  After that week,
Stormyr was finally saw for the first time in the encampment.  Blood
soaked, scarred across his entire body.  All except his arms were
healed, a supposed reminder for the young felar.  The entire demeanor
of the felar was changed afterwards.  Quiet, flinching every time the
human would turn around to say something to him.  Attentive as well,
listening to everything that was spoke to him.  Countless years
passed after that week, and finally Stormyr became a journeyman.  The
human that brought him to the encampment gave him a new name,
Dregarius.  He sent the young felar to the realms of Thera in order
to learn more from other assassins there, to broaden his education.  
 
Before the portal was opened, and Dregarius went through, he was teamed
up with another. A fellow Felar from his own tribe, Faen, was sent with
him to broaden both their educations in their craft. Dregarius,
remembering the young felar, hardly looked at him unless asked to by 
the human master. Several times after their entrance into the world of
Thera they have been seen together, working on their skills.
