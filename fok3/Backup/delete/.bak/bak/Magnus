Desc Standing before you is a tall male felar.  He stands around 25
hands tall and weighs approximately 80 stones.  Magnus is hairy and
extremely agile.  His face is round, with deep bloodshot eyes that
glare around him constantly.  He has two large, prominent tatoos on
his arms.  These show lineage in the felar, signifying the length of
time he has spent on Thera.  Magnus's skin is a pale, sickly beige,
even paler than the skins of most felars.  He carries himself with a
confident air, as do most creatures of his strength and dexterity. 
On his hip he has several small belt pouches hanging from his belt,
as well as a large sword to slay his enemies with.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of Magnus and his history, all that I can tell you
are the rumors that are going around the local taverns.  Magnus
supposedly comes from the very old thieves guild, deep under some
ancient city of darkness.  He spent his childhood there, learning
from the outcasts and dregs of the underworld, and also honing his
skills as a thief and pickpocket.  He learned how to camouflage
Himself, how to dodge, parry, block, and all the other skills and
abilities that are often necessary to survive in the oft dangerous
world of Thera.  Some believe that Magnus came out of the city when
it was savagely pillaged by an unknown group.  Magnus had been out
hunting at the time, and came back to his beloved if filthy city to
find only ashes, spirits, and the distinct odor of an ancient enemy. 
Since then, Magnus has wandered the realms of Thera, searching for
those who had destroyed his city.  During his travels, Magnus has met
many different people, some which were good, some bad.  Many of these
fellow travelers taught Magnus important lessons and useful skills,
all of which Magnus added to his repertoire.  He has gathered
information about the movements, whereabouts, strengths, and
weaknesses about his foes, and is now training to move on his enemy. 
And when he does finally go up against his mortal enemies, he will
show them the same mercy that they showed on his beloved city.
