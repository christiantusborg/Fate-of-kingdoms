Back Shadrim was born and raised deep inside the many mountains north
in Thera.  His father was a simple citizen of Sanaria, and so the
same for his mother.  Shadrim grew to become a merchand.  With his
wings, he could reach the villages in hours.  Although, the affairs
suddently turned bad, and his family could not support him.  Shadrim
then moved to New Thalos.  He left merchandise aside, and decided to
work as an entertainer.  He danced for living.  Throughout his many
dance courses, he learned that a form of magical power could be
created, with just a few moves with his body.  Something facinating,
something dangerous..  He stopped dancing for people, and began
studies on what he had discovered.  Not much told explained the
reasons of this form of power, nor where it came from.  But with a
few moves with his body, he could create fireballs, and bring wolves
aside.  He then began exploring the world, searching for ones that
practiced his art.  As for his parents, they both died of age.  They
did not live to see Shadrim in the mature ages, neither they lived to
see him dance.  With more time, he learned to control his powers.  He
began using them against a few beasts.  With a few that he had met
with time, he hunted the forests, for training and practice.  In a
second or so, he could create almost anything he wanted.  He was not
the same as before, he turned over to combat, with unusual powers.. 
His mind had evolved, his personality has changed.  He was not the
same man with his parents anymore..
