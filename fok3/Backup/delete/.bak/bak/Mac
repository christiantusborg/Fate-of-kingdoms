Desc A pixie male floats before you, about four fingers tall, and one stone 
in weight, dead average for his race.  However, his aqua-marine eyes 
are anything but.  The color swirls around the iris sometimes even 
leaking into the whites, and in doing so it reveals his close 
connection with the aether.  His eyes shift about the room, seemingly 
searching for something.  Short, jet-black hair stands straight off of 
his head, held in place by an unseen force.  Wings similar to a 
dragonfly's flutter behind his back.  Despite all of these things, the 
most prominent feature of this pixie is a jagged scar that runs from 
above his left ear to his right shoulder.  It pulses and undulates 
with energy, straining the skin.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Many people know of this pixie freak.  He was born under the sign 
of the Strider during a new moon, and his parents were disgusted 
when they saw the warped being that they had brought into this 
world.  They dumped him in the garbage, and he was forced to 
sleep there overnight, hiding from the rats and cockroaches.  The 
next morning he awoke with a start, and, after taking a look 
around, he knew he had to flee.  He ran from his home, to lands 
unknown.  On the way he learned many things, the hard way.  His 
twisted body didn't improve his disposition. Convoluted thoughts 
began to take root.  He was good, and kind, but very, very 
strange...
Skip forward 20 years, Mac was an adventurer in Thera when an old 
human alchemist named Geoph approached him with a rather strange 
proposition, it seemed that the old man feared death and wished 
to exchange bodies with the young pixie.  Geoph offered Mac 
untold riches.  Mac readily accepted the offer, and although the 
procedure was dangerous, he survived, in the body of a one-
hundred-year-old human.  With his newfound wealth, he decided to 
buy his own island kingdom, which he ruled over for many years.  
However, as the years past, he became more and more aware of his 
advanced age.  He turned to the notes Geoph had given him, to try 
to find a way to make his old body young again.
As he toiled day after day in his laboratory, his kingdom slowly 
fell into ruin and disrepair, many of the inhabitants moved away, 
but none of this deflected Mac from his goal.  In fact, he was 
completely unaware of what was going on in the outside world.  
Finally Mac realized, as Geoph had realized before him, that it 
was impossible to "turn back the clock", and he redirected his 
research.  In weeks he had a solution, to construct a body using 
the ether itself, and then transfer himself into it as he had 
transferred into Geoph's body.
Mac had started out as a pixie, and that's what he wanted to be, 
but he did not want to ever again be known as a freak.  The body 
he created was one of a dead-average pixie, no distinguishing 
marks at all, exactly how he wanted it.  The transfer was a 
success and Mac rushed out to show the world his new body, and 
was amazed at what he found.
The island he had ruled over was completely abandoned, and all 
the buildings had fallen down except for his castle.  Mac was 
saddened but resolved to go adventuring once again.  So he set
out, and soon discovered that the rest of the world was in a 
similar state.  Eager to find out what had transpired while he 
was away, he searched for records, but he found none.  But he did 
stumble upon a large obsidian gate, glowing with energy.  As he 
passed through it, he realized what it was, an inter-dimensional 
portal, and as he felt it guide him to another dimension he 
realized how he could do it without the help of the portal.  When 
he arrived at the other side found himself in a strange new land.  
Immediately, he was attacked by numerous foes.  He defended 
himself well, but one managed to give him a deep gash from above 
his left ear to his right shoulder.  Mac quickly called upon the 
new dimension-jumping magic he had learned to escape.
He journeyed through many dimensions, for many years and finally 
found himself on Thera once again.  The Thera he returned to was 
full of new and exciting things, a far cry from the Thera he had 
left so many years ago.
