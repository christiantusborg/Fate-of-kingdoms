Desc Something is terribly wrong with the little creature that floats
before you Where other pixies you've seen across Thera had a childish
charm and a kindness Evident in their features, this particular one
appear almost warped into something A lot less appealing...  Instead
of almost transparent wings this pixie has taken on some rather
astounding And demonoid proportions with slim slightly tattered
batlike wings.  Its skin has an Sickingly pale grey color and its
hair is long, black and kept in what looks like filthy Thin braids. 
Its tiny hands have long slender fingers ending in what appears to be
sharpened nails, And both its hands and the lower parts of its arms
bear several scars and burns.  Its face is dominated by two large
oval eyes that are completely black-in-black with no Visible iris. 
Its mouth seems to constantly maintain a slightly sulky and sour
expression Making It look almost as a thin line drawn with charcoal
that's only seldomly broken by a Quick smile that looks more
predatory than charming.  Its clothes are in a very poor and filthy
condition and are kept completely in black and Darkgreen colors.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Wyrn's painfull existance began in the light, yet somewhere along
the path of his life the Darkness managed to sieze his soul clinging
onto it so fervently that one might describe it As a malignant curse
so sinister that it cannot possibly be cured...  Like most pixies
Wyrn was touched with the gift of magic from birth.  His parents did
their Best to nurish and strengthen this spark within him, and they
succeeded...  At first...  Do not be mistaken...  Wyrn was not born
evil, nor is he evil now.  Until his 15th year Wyrn Appeared to be as
pixie younglings are most, although his prowess in the art magic
might Have been more developed, yet around this time Wyrn suddenly
seem to become distant to The world around him.  Both his family and
the small community of pixies with whom he Lived began to feel
slightly worried about the antisocial and sometimes even hostile
young Pixie, yet nothing seemed to break thru the mental barrier Wyrn
had suddenly placed between Himself and the rest of the world.  Wyrn
began to wander away from the village during night sometimes
remaining out of sight For several days.  Whenever anyone could even
get close enough to have a good look at him, They were shocked by his
sickly appearance that gave the impression of someone who had Been
without sleep for weeks.  After a year had passed with Wyrn's visits
to the village being less and less frequent he had Seemingly vanished
from the face of the earth and none of the attempts to locate him
made By his parents and the village council have had any success...
