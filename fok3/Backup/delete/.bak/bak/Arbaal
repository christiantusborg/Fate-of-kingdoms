Desc {yAn enormous pile of various refuse towers before you, nearing twelve feet tall. While all manner of things are
included it seems as if the majority of the bulk is made up of a variety of animal skins, both dangerous and 
domestic. Bones of various sizes hang haphazardly about the object and the stench of rotting flesh assails your
nostrols. There appears to be a number of rats or mice which scurry over the hulking form before you.
 
With one slow, meanful swipe of it's trunklike arms a portion of the hides falls away to reveal the creature
underneath. As would be expected, there was a giant hidden beneath the "clothing". Standing approximately ten feet
tall, and you would assume weighing close to five hundred stone, the being looks about himself with a calm demeanor.
 
Long, grey hair falls from the top of his skull down to slightly past his shoulders. Dull, grey eyes can be seen
from between the strands of hair. Strong jaw muscles lead your eyes towards his mouth full of mismatched, unclean 
teeth. His massive torso is dark brown and hairless, criscrossed with long jagged scars from what appears to have
been blade wounds

Back {yBeing raised in a giant camp on the plains west of Sanaria, Arbaal found himself having much contact with humans
throughout his upbringing. From an early age, Arbaal found he could easily best most of the guards which protected
the city of Sanaria. Throughout his teenage years, Arbaal was often found in the sparring pits of Sanaria, practicing
his combat skills. Arbaal was happy living in the giant camp, and practicing in the city, but before too long he
became restless. 
 
Having heard of a group of mercenaries known as the HORDE, Arbaal took what belongings he had and left Sanaria. It
seemed as if he travelled east for weeks, and eventually came across the city known as New Thalos, from there he heard
more of the group and eventually stumbled upon their stronghold. Arbaal became an easy victim to their magic hating
ways, and soon was one of their most frenzied members. Hunting throughout the lands for any and all who practiced
the magical arts and putting them to death.
 
Unfortunately for Arbaal his luck could not last. While hunting a particularily dangerous draconian defiler, Arbaal
was cursed by the creature before it flew out of his reaches. Thinking his tribal protections would be enough, Arbaal
returned to the HORDE stronghold beneath the forest. As he travelled, whispers could be heard from throughout the
forest, but when investigated no one could be found. The whispering got worse as time passed, and fleeting images 
of those he had slain became visible... but only when he did not look directly. 
 
The panicked Arbaal raced for the stronghold that he hoped would quiet the spirits about him but to his dismay, he
met armed brothers at the gate. Believing him to have taken up magery, and be a traitor, Arbaal was captured and thrown
into their jail. Over the next years, he rotted. Only let out of his cell when the sadistic mercenaries wished to
torture him. The spirits continued. 
 
Slowly the demeanor of the spirits changed. Instead of tormenting him, they began to aid him. They attempted to 
block the blows of the HORDE whips, and they would try unsuccessfully to bring more food and water to Arbaal.
In secret Arbaal began attempting to communicate and found he could use the spirits as his own form of magical power.
 
One night after a particularily successful raid upon the tower of ASPER the brothers of HORDE were celebrating. Arbaal
sent the spirits to the forest above to use this time to free him. When the brothers were in a drunken stupor, a pack
of wild animals burst into their rooms. Surprised, they were ripped assunder before they were even able to reach
for their weapons.
 
After the slaughter a worn and tired Arbaal stumbled from the desecrated HORDE stronghold, never to return.
