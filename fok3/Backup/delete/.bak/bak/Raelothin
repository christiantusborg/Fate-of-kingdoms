Desc A male drow is here.  He looks like he stands around six feet
tall, and weighs possibly 100 pounds.  Maybe more, maybe less.  It's
hard to tell, as his frame is rather nondescript.  He is neither
muscular, nor is he frail.  Raelothin's face is finely chisled, as is
the trademark of the elven kind.  His large, almond-shaped eyes are
clear, and the irises are a startling deep jade.  Raelothin wears his
hair pulled back, and it is almost shoulder length.  It's stark
whiteness stands out against the cool grey of his flesh.  He carries
himself with an air of self importance, yet he still looks
uncomfortable to be in the realms of those who walk under the sun.

Back Raelothin comes from the ancestral drow homeworld.  Truly, this is
about the extent of outlander's knowledge of him.  He comes from a
family of high standing, rulers among the strict heirarchy of the
dark elves.  Raelothin did not choose to leave the drow lands.  He
was, instead, pulled from them.  On a particular night (night by
underground reckoning), he recieved a message in a dream.  Usually,
he would pay no heed to such a thing.  But this message was clear. 
Ang urgent.  And, it was delivered by a most unusual messenger.  In
the mists of Raelothin's mind, a form took shape.  The form was tall,
and fair.  It was the form of the most despised enemy in drowish
history.  An elf.  The elf smiled kindly at him, almost patronizing. 
He spoke to Raelothin about many things, about a mysterious force
that all could feel, if they were attuned to it.  He spoke of the
hope he had in Raelothin, and of the powers he could posess, if he
willed it.  He spoke of peace of mind, something that was naught to
be found among the deadly world of the drow.  And, finally, he spoke
of where he could be found.  With that, he left.  Raelothin woke the
next morning in a state of disarray.  His head hurt, and he was
confused.  He quietly slipped out of his palace home, and packed all
he would need for the long journey to the worlds above.  It took many
days for Raelothin's eyes to adjust to the harsh light of the
overworlds.  He spent most of his time under shady bowyers and in
craggy rocks to shade himself.  Finally, though, his eyes settled,
and he could walk in the sun unhindered.  Raelothin found his
bearings easy enough, and made straight for the city of his
destination.  He would seek out the melting pot of Sanaria, and he
would find the elf who came in his dream.  Those who know Raelothin
know him to be a drow of honor, as is bred into his kin.  Yet the
contempts he felt for all the "other" races when he first surfaced
are slowly starting to melt away.  Only now does he see himself not
as a superior forced to live among dogs, but as one part of a larger
world.  His cruel nature can still surface, however.  Those faced
with the harshness of his deep jade eyes do not feel easy about it. 
And, he will do whatever neccessary to ensure his gaining of power in
the magic.  He does, in many ways, reinforce the old stereotype of
the self-serving wizard.  Raelothin's magical powers are admittedly
weak compared to the great mages he so envies, but they are growing. 
Every day brings a new discovery of power, a new energy to wield. 
Yet he will not be content with himself until he has reached the
xenith of power.  He will not rest, can not rest.  Raelothin will
make his people proud, will make those who oppose tremble.
