Desc The young Felar that stands before you weighs around 130 stones
and is 6 paces in height.  He has long, muscular arms and legs and
modest waist.  His face is round, his eyes and mouth are small and
his ears are pointy.  At first sight, you can easily see that he is a
built up being, and that he is no pushover.  He has long brown hiar,
which match his brown eyes.  And he has hair growing out under his
nose, like whiskers.  He is an odd looking being.

Back This young Felar has lived an interesting childhood filled with
extra-ordinary events.  He was born into a middle-class Sanarian
family of Alchemists.  He was educated, well nourished and looked
after.  Although he was a priviliged child, the constant fights
between his parents tore him apart.  He would cry night and day and
pray that one day both his parents would come to their senses and
stop fighting.  The problems grew to a point where his parents
decided to seperate, and so begins the costudy battle over Flen.  In
the midst of all this hate, Flen had become neglected and forgotten. 
It is then that the young boy decides to flee Sanaria and leave for
New Thalos, where he hoped to begin a new life.  Upon arriving in New
Thalos, Flen pursues to find a job.  Unable to find work in New
Thalos he decided to head back to Sanaria, but before he leaves he is
taken in by a band of thieves who give him food and shelter.  Flen,
who is prepared to do anything to make sure he does not have to
return to Sanaria, decides to join the thieves.  He masters all the
necessary skills and begins to roam the streets of New Thalos in
search of merchandise.  He quickly becomes reknown for his ability to
deceive even the smartest of beings.
