Desc {CI{cnfront of you stands a fat Merma in
ragged clothes. His bluish green skin is
covered in shiny scales. You take a wild guess
that he is about as tall as 15 hand-widths, and
as heavy as 650 pebble stones. You also
notice his thick muscular arms that reminds 
you of a trunk of a tree. He smiles constantly
and openes his arms wide to embrace
the summoned animals around him.
 
{CT{che only thing that stands out 
from his first impression is the arcane
writings of enchantments written all over
his ragged cloaks. He is wearing many
varieties of jewlaries from necklaces
made of a shark's teeth, an eyeball of
an atrocious beast, and a bracelet of a
dragon's hide etc. There is an aura of 
unknown friendliness and mystery... it
slowly surrounds your presence as you
approach closer.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back The origin of Gauthus is unknown. His first encounter
with the world as of we know today was at a tender age
of 8. In a city where human kinds enslaved exotic 
creatures, this Merma definantly stood out among
the crowd. Captured, he learned the harshness of life
much quicker than the children of his age. He was
strapped and beaten on a daily basis and was given
left over food to just continuate his harsh life.
At the age of 11, He meets a wise sage, an elven
priest, and his group of bandits. Among the many
slaves they've rescued included Gauthus. From that
point Gauthus decides to follow the steps of the
priestly ways that granted him the taste of freedom.
The ways were however too harsh for a Merma who didn't
speak the Elven tongue. At the age of 16, Gauthus makes
one of the most important decisions in his life. He 
becomes a Shaman after the famouse Naila the Shaman
he has studies in the scriptures. He soon learns the
ways of the Shamans: the caller of life, the enchanters of
the forest. In matter of a year, he proves himself as
an astounding member of Foresteers, the group of elite
bandits that raided villages of human. He even recheas 
the deepest core of Shaman magic. At the age of 19
he becomes the first Merma to be a respected member of 
the Shaman society of Elf town. 
 
However, there was another turn of event in his life.
After becoming a leader of a small clan that supposedly
devoted all its power to be one with the natures pure
magic, he works on a gateway that leads to the other
realm of this dimension. Failures after failures, he
manages to succeed in his life time work. The gateway
lead the the realm of Thera. Gauthus believe this realm
to be the "harmonious continent" where all creatures
and races co-existed to create a world. According to
his theory, there was balance that held the races 
together. So he set off into an unknown dimension in
search of the "pure source", or binding magic.
 
His theories were indeed correct. The new world contained
so much of unused harness floating in the air that it
was enough to bind the forces of magic itself. After
collecting enough mana for the final step of his experiment,
he uttered the arcane words of portal. Disaster happened.
The nature's binding magic, startled by the myterious power
of a Shaman's command, decided to respond their stress
in forms of destruction. Ground shook violently with anger,
collars of fire errupted in the air, and vicious demon-like
creatures screamed in agony. The gaetway which was the only
mean of his return was eradicated comepletely. Heavily injured
he called upon a forest familiar as his rescuer. Instead of a
mighty giant phoenix with powerful firey wings came a poweful
rush of energy he has never felt before. Within a flash, 
everything was surrounded in darkness and Gauthus was left
with a strange new "source". He stood up shaking off the dirt
off his cloaks with an austeer look.
on his face.
