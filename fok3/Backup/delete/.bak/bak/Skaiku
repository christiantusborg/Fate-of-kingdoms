Desc Before you stand a medium sized darnok.
He is about 160 centimeters tall.
If you tried to find him in a crowd it would be like finding a spesific rock in a cave.
In his backpack he hides all his belonging that he dont want stranger to see.
He is quite muscular and you dont want to try to steal from him.
He is a nice guy even though he is a thief.
If you asked him for help he would most likely help you.
He has only one goal in life, and that is to kill Morgan one day.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Skaiku was born in the city of Sanaria.  His parents were poor,
but still they loved their only son as high as a someone can love a
person.  Skaiku's father had no permanent job and went from one job
to another.  When Skaiku passed the age of 8 his father died in an
accident.  While riding through a dense forest on his horse he was
robbed by a band of outlaws and badly wounded.  He lived for another
week before he passed away.  Skaiku's mother was blind after beeing
exposed to acid a few years before, and therefore she couldn't work. 
So young Skaiku had to keep his mother with food and drink, now when
the father of the family was gone.  Skaiku was a cleaver boy and ripe
for his age so he managed to get some money, but it was not much. 
Skaiku's best friends, the brothers Boqus and Borus, suggested Skaiku
could work for their family and at the same time get shelter and
food.  So when Skaiku was 10, he and his mother moved in at the house
of the Bodenhaise family.  Skaiku scrubbed floors and he helped with
the food.  Some times he stole a few silver coins from the
Bodenhaises.  Father Elnsberg Bodenhaise did notice, but he didn't do
anything.  After all the Bodenhaises were wealthy, while poor Skaiku
and his mother had nothing.  But when Skaiku had reached the age of
16, he felt evilness dwell inside his body.  He felt an urge to do
evil and later he set fire to the Bodenhaise mansion.  The house
burnt down to ashes and Boqus' brother, Borus as well as Boqus'
parents and Skaiku's mother died in the fire.  Boqus, the only
survivour of the Bodenhaise family, suspected that Skaiku had done
this, but depressed as he was after loosing his family he didn't say
anything and after all he had no evidence as well.  After this Skaiku
had no home and he became a filthy vagrant, roaming the lands.  He
soon found that stealing was an easy way of getting money, and he
became a full time thief.  The evilness inside him never left and
therefore he chose the dark path.  His childhood friend, Boqus,
wanted vengeance over the evil that had taken from him his family, so
he choosed to become a paladin, a white knight.  Skaiku is still a
thief of evil and walks around all over the world.  If you see him
you better be careful, because this fellow is pure evil and you wont
know what he'll do next!
