Back Azreath was born in a town called felincia.  Its main inhabitants
were Felar's.  Although it did have a few human families around.  It
was a quiet little town in the middle of a forest.  For the most part
it was peaceful, but if the need came they could be one of the most
feared towns in there part of Thera.  The town was never attacked and
therefor never had to show or use its power.  After so many years of
never being able to use his powers Azreath started to get angry.  He
was known as one of the most powerful, if not the most powerfull,
people of his village.  And he wanted to use his powers.  So on his
16th birthday he had a very big party.  People from all over came,
and even his worst enemy Threx from the next village over came. 
Azreath hated Threx with a passion.  Azreath even swore that if Threx
ever did even the smallest thing to make him mad he would kill him on
the spot.  And that very thing happened at his 16th birthday party. 
Threx began taking the spot light from Azreath by showing off his
petty magical talent.  This pushed Azreath over the edge from being
angry to going insane.  He without thinking walked to the middle of
the fairground where the party was being held and with the help of
his forest tiger slayed Threx in cold blood.  This did not go over
well with the people of the town or with the people from Threx's
town.  This almost started a war between the two towns.  But they
both made an agreement that if Azreath was banished from the town
they wouldnt start a war over his doings.  So the people of Felincia
decided to banish Azreath forever from there town and they would look
upon him as they do all other evil things in the world from then on. 
So Azreath was foreced to leave the village and go out on his own. 
After leaving the village Azreath made Southwest in search of a new
place to live.  He travelled for many days through dense forest and
soon he came to a road.  He followed this road west and soon came to
a city known as Sanaria.  When he got there he decided to buy himself
a small house and stay in this area of the world and try his luck.
