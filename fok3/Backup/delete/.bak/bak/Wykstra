Desc You see a dark figure standing before you.  The shadow-y figure is
no more than 10 inches tall, but still a frightning sight.  He has a
long scar over both eyes.  Wykstra's build is average for a pixie. 
He wears a shiney breast plate.  Nothing is worn underneath the
breast plate, a tattoo is engraved in his right and left arm. 
Wykstra's face is long, he has strong cheek bones and a hardened,
aged look.  His eyes are tight slits in his face, only the black of
his eyes can be seen.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  His story startes a few
years back.  Wykstra was returning home from a long hard day at work.
Upon entering his yard, he notices a body on the floor.  The body was
mangled and blood was everywhere.  A very pissed Wykstra was born... 
Now Wykstra travels the roads searching for what happend that
horrible day.  After about a year of travel he met two travelers,
Romos and Kibano.  Wykstra currently travels the astranged road with
his only companions left in the world.  He often gets blindly drunk
and rampages off to pick on things weaker than him, however when
sober he always fights things that COULD dissembol him.  Wykstra's
strange obsession with booze has made him quite acceptable to
punishment.  And also rather insane.  At times you can catch him
giving a complete stranger a lapdance, breaking tings over a person's
skulls, or something not usually done by intellec tual types.  Soon
afterwards he will belch loudly and passout.  His only form of
relaxation after a long hard day of killing and drinking is
meditation.  Wykstra has only recently accepted the concept of god,
and is currently very religous.  However, Wykstra often changes paths
and it cannot be determined what he will believe in next.  Although
religous, Wykstra believe's he stands on his own.  Fate doesn't
control him, so he does random things quite often.
