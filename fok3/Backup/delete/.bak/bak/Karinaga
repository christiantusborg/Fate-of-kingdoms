Desc {x Karinaga Yamashita, a soldier of bushido, stands a full stature
of six feet with a full muscular structure and a figure of a built
adult.  His skin complection is a mid tan evenly over his body,
though not a bronze, however it gives a healthy look.  Atop of his
head he has a head full of thick dark and rich lustrious hair, pulled
back into a tail which is slightly wavy, held by a thin dark navy
blue band.  A few stray locks of hair dangle in his mature face,
appearing maybe in his mid twenties.  A set of dull deep brown eyes
focus with a lighter tan tint as they fade into the obsidian pupils. 
Sharp black eyebrows lay atop of the brow of this chisled face with
high cheeks, pointy nose, and chisled masculine chin.  Aside from his
sideburns appear a pair of tannish regular pointy ears, looking like
any ordinary.  Along his forehead is a strange foreign symbol made of
tattos, a simple red three lines which resemble calligraphy writings
along with intersecting designs and patterns.  His thick neck leads
down to a heavy and broad pair of shoulders which carry the brute
muscular arms, raw with power.  Though not the size of a giant muscle
bound figure his form is tight with a chisled chest and set of abs,
obvious from excessive training and excersize.  Along his back
contains strange symbols of blackness with lines which of his regular
tanned skin flow through randomly and jaggedly connecting to a star
figure with the five points of tinted red lotus blossoms.  This
structured man is obviously comfortable with his movements and skill,
only commonly wearing a very light pair of armor.  A set of shoulder
covers with a set of spikes, and a light set of gote guards which
along the thin chest plate of the deep gray mixed with gray has a
strange symbol, that of a red cresent moon, which resembles on both
arm plates, chest plates and a tattoo on each arm.  Along those sleek
pair of legs is a thick set of hakama pants with a heavy set of boots
on those balanced and large feet.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back {x Born in an early era of the century, Karinaga was given birth
before sunset in a common family in the Iukijimo village.  A small
village with a population of fifty along a shore with a large sand
bar near a hill and a cliff which looks over to the west sea.  He
grew up living in a vast society of quick running warriors and very
few masters.  Training underneath his father which was an adequet
fighter underneath the sword of the Keigiri.  His father, surviving
the dangerous eras of the village and defending the town from
foreigners and keeping it pure, he has lived from many invasions to
pass his sword to his son, Karinaga.  The times were slowly shifting,
and with such a small town and large territory, the members of each
of the several jitsu arts joined together for a conquest.  Finally,
war experience, being at the keen age of sixteen, and having some
battle experience, He was eager to fight the next day.  However,
tragety struck, and war began early.  Yujimojo of the Serpents had
lead the attack against the Iukijimo.  Battle cries were heard miles
away, the foreigner kingdoms attacked with advice of Yujimojo, the
night raid killed most while the rest surrendered from most men,
women and children were killed, including the village chief.  Most of
the villagers were taken prisoner left to rot, or they commited
seppuku, or ran away such as Karinaga, their village was burnt to the
ground and left in rubble for smite, leaving the remainder villagers
to live in misery for the remainder of their lives, only a dozen were
left and known as the lucky survivors from the vicious sneak attack,
Gathering the rest of the dozen he made a small group of
preservitist, falling in love easily with a woman Kairimi the young
beautiful teen of the group.  Only a few elderly, few children, and
rest between aged felt it was necissary to continue on to find a
place for living first, travelling along the shore and following it
untill they found a very primitive village, quite small but fairly
adequet.  They had gained a few followers and Reikugawa the aged
'sword master' of the group lead this small clan to almost double or
triple it's original size, Karinaga himself had a young newborn on
the way.  Reikugawa the master of two swords was struck down during a
battle with a rival town which was a few miles down the vallies.  The
battle was now a tie and mass confusion was mixed into the clan
unable to fight, Karinaga took control and hid the defenseless with a
few good warriors to attack the leader of the foreign barbarian
leader.  That rebel captain soon fell and both sides were too tired
to continue, so the barbarians fled with tails between their legs. 
Without question, Karinaga soon became the new leader of the clan.
