Immtitle Immortal~
Back Xeqtr has just passed his Gauntlet,having answered thousands of
questions about Law,hurled at him like Pila of Fire from all sides. 
It didn`t help that his master Kerberos has an uncanny habit of
walking around with two extra images of himself,all of whom asked
rapid fire questions,along with Kerberos familiar too.  Life as an
apprentice wasn`t easy.  Well,no.  Life as an apprentice was a living
hell,sometimes even worse than life before Kerberos rescued him from
the streets of Thessaly,where he lived by stealing after his parents
threw him bodily out of the small house where they lived and worked. 
Kerberos seemed like an avenging angel then,when he and his hound
sent the street pirates running in terror.  But not for long. 
Kerberos insisted on perfection,insisted that House Guernicus
embodied the principle of perfect and unwavering interpretation of
the Code of Hermes,insisted that his apprentice be perfect.  Nothing
could be hidden from Kerberos unblinking vigilance.  Sometimes he
used his foridable array of Mentem magics,but he rarely needed to. 
Both he and his familiar could literally smell fear.  Not only smell
fear,but smell shades of fear,the way a normal person might discern
pink from red or purple.  But now freedom is near.  Relative
freedom,since every Quaesitor has duties that cannot be denied and
must answer to his House.  Xeqtrs intends to leave his master and
make his own way in the order.  He has also begun to consider that
there is something inherently wrong with his master`s way of doing
things.  He intends to oppose Kerberos and his ideas,subtly,until he
gains enough power and reputation to stand openly agains Kerberos and
the twisted values he represents.  As for Thessaly,nothing remains
there for Xeqtr.  While travelling on an errand for Kerberos,Xeqtr
made a short detour through Thessaly.  No one recognized him,yet
people glowered at him from doorways,spat at him behind his back when
they thought he would notice,and tried to cheat him at every turn. 
But this time Xeqtr was not afraid.  He silently used is magic to
cheat those who would cheat him,and with a glance sent those who
would harm him.  Running in fear.  His father did not recognize him
when he almost bought a stone table from him,but tried to overcharge
him and misrepresent the quality of his offerings.  The mundane world
has few consolations to offer a magus save when magic is used to make
it more accomodating,usually through Mentem spells,cast most often on
woman.  Only the company and respect of peers in the Order and
perhaps the love of God for the world despite itself matter.
