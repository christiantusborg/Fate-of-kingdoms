Immtitle Immortal~
Back Xillanth was bornIt on the Day of Freedom, 25th in the Month of
Nature in a small treehouse in Gondor 137 years ago.  Inspired by
nature, Xillanth got the urge to discover it's mysteries and at an
early age he learned to meditate in harmony with his surroundings. 
Xillanth's parents which were part of the Gondorian army were trying
to make a warrior out of him and they did indeed do a good work with
his sword and bow skills, but due to Xillanth's attachment to nature
he skipped a few classes at the warrior school which made him miss
out on some proficiencies.  After a long argument Xillanth was
allowed to follow the path of the ranger.  He was sent to his
grand-grand father who lived in a tree just outside Gondor to focus
on the forces of nature.  Just a few decades ago Gondor was attacked
by ruthless evil forces and in the war that lasted for 20 years,
Xillanth's grand-grand father fell in the last year.  Gondor was left
behind with moderate casualties...  But that that had suffered the
most casualties was the forest, trees were left behind convoulsing on
the ground and begging for help.  This enraged Xillanth, and he was
determined to give the nature it's venegance to the Evil that wounded
it.  Xillanth said goodbye to his parents and traveled north to a
Place called Sanaria.  He searched around and found the entrance to
the MUD-School.  He stayed there for a few years and soon he
graduated with honour and 107 silver pieces.  He had now also learned
to use the forces of nature to heal his wounds.  After graduating
Xillanth emediatly initiated his campaign starting with getting rid
of the evil scum that lurked around in the city.  Later on he
returned to the forest he loved so much and hunted down the evil
there too.  After returning to Sanaria he pleeded citzenship there
and with good help from some close friends there his case was
accepted.  Now and then Xillanth returns to Gondor to visit his
family and meditate with his grand-grand father's soul.
