is...  Well..  Hes nice and kind..  He is hard to describe actually..
But what you see is that he has a rather strong figure, and he is
normal in height, he does also have midnight black hair and gleaming
deep green eyes..  Other then that he is a plain natural dwarf.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Grazzt was born in the the sign of Coming.  He was born in the
forest where he and his parents lived..  When he reached the age of
11he was abanoned by his parents due to very much lack of coins to
feed him..  He was later found by some warriors that were on a journy
to defeat great forces of evil..  One of their leaders took him into
his family..  He soon showed great skills with sword and other
weapons..  The leader was impressed so he soon understood that this
boy had the blood of a warrior in his vains He was in great battles
against evil and he did vanquish some very strong enemies as a older
boy..  At the age of 16 Grazzt had few enemies and alot of friends
due to respect he gained from killing evil..  Some of those friends
were Mhyle and Sesori..  The did spend time together vanquishing some
mob and having a good time around eachother At the age of 17 he has
grwon even stronger and have more friends..  He likes it his hometown
witch is Sanaria..  Grazzts pimary goal would be that he wants to rid
the world of all evil and bring peace to Thera and all the ones
living there..  But he knows for sure that he can rid Thera of evil
not even with the help from others An old saying says that "THere
cannot be peace without evil and without evil there cannot be good"
He will for certain meet new friends in the future that might share
hes interests of bringing peace to Thera..  But for now he might be
alone..  In time grazzt think he can conqurer some big old evil beast
and demons of somekind..  But fo now he will only take out the evil
he finds in the near of home..  He likes his life style so he's going
to keep it that way..  Also he has made alot of friends in Thera and
he has not meet any enemies..  Yet..  Now Grazzt has made even more
firends then before..  He has now spent most of his time growing so
that he can kill bigger threats and stuff like that..  He has now
becom what you may call a warrior Grazzt has shown good behavior and
is not the guy that will bother asking the evil if it wants to turn
to the good side..  (as if that would ever happen) Now he has made
some new friends who helps him in his journy..  Hurrdraell and
Maanzecorian are these friends.  They have been vanquishing some bigg
mobs in a short matter of time.  Even though both of them are
evilaligned..  That doesnt seem to bother him m Now he has made some
new friends who helps him in his journy..  Hurrdraell and
Maanzecorian are these friends.  They have been vanquishing some bigg
mobs in a short matter of time.  Even though both of them are
evilaligned..  That doesnt seem to bother him much..  His only happy
to make new friends i these though times ( dont look at my
spellings..  I know there are alot of mistakes..  :D ) Now i have
been choosen to be a member of the Kingdom Lurai..  This was my goal
after getting my venganse on those who kille my parents I have also
made alot of new friends wich i spend time with Some of my actions
will hopefully be forgiven by those this conserns
