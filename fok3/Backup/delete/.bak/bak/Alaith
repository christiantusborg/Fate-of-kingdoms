Desc Before you stands a younge elven woman.  Her
hair is a fiar silver that glistens under both
the sun and the stars.  Her eyes look tired,
though alert, as though a deep weary consumes
her.  A soft smile graces her lips but one
can tell her heart is not in it.
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Among the wisest men of Thera, you find that little 
is known of this young Felar.  Among the gossips you 
learn little more than what is most generally known; 
what happened after he came to Sanaria.  It is not
until you happen upon an old sage that you discover
anything that is actually true of his past.
 
  The old man's face is dirty, and skin looks like old
dried leather.  Even so, you can see happiness and a
spark of youth still glimers in his eyes.  As you sit
before him, he offers a drink of some sort, vaguely
familiar yet not so at the same time.  You drink it
and set your cup down as the old man rolls his head
backwards and starts to cackle in a hideous laughter.
Before you have the chance to ask why, the world begins
to spin and heave this way and that.
 
  There is a elf sitting beneath the trees that you
can see beneath you.  She appears to be crying.  As
she leans back, you see a bundle in her arms and only
then do you recognize that it is not her crying at all,
but the new child held in her arms.  Your vision begins
to fog over and again the world spins away from your
control.
 
  It is the same young woman, but something has changed
in her appearance.  She seems calm, yet distant.  It is
as though she is removed from the world.  You follow
her gaze out across the river she is staring into. A 
small basket can be seen gently floating down the river
and you can only assume what is inside.  Again the same
reeling comes over you but this time your ready for it.
The scene changes easily without causing you to become
confused.
 
  There is a small band of human travelers heading to
some unknown destination.  You suddenly realize that
they are not moving, but merely standing in one spot
waiting for something.  A young woman comes forward out
of a clearing.  She is carrying something.  She talks
with, no pleads with a man nearby.  After some time,
he nods his head and everyone gets back to the road to
continue their travel.  The scene changes again.
 
  The young women emerges from a small house, but she
no longer has the same lightness to her step.  You can
notice some grey wisps of hair across her face as well
as a few wrinkless near her eyes when she smiles. A
young but strong she-elf comes across the Town Square,
but something is wrong. The world slows down and you
can see a stone flying through the air. It hits her
and you see her wince but nothing more.  Again, a
change.
 
  The Elf and the woman are sitting at a table.
Neither of them speak, but still a tension can be
felt throughout the room.  The young Elf puts her
fork down and speaks a few words to the woman. She
can only nod her head as tears begin to fall from her
cheaks. She gets up, grabs a few items, and leaves.
 
  The Elf is walking a path that you recognize,
yet cannot place in your own mind.  You can see trees
to her left, and a river to her right.  As she looks
up, she stops and a slow smile spreads across her face.
You follow her eyes and finially understand.  A city
is there, with the words 'Sanaria' across the nearby
gate.
