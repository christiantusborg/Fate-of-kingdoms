Desc {xA powerful female warrior stands before you.  You wonder in
surprise who(Or more precisely..  What?)  Is she?  
Her strong body seems to be made of {DS{Wo{wli{Wd S{wto{Wn{De.
{xShe's wearing a {BB{br{Wi{wg{Wht{w B{Wl{bu{Be{x and {RR{re{Rd{x Armor.
Her hair is tied in a Long Ponytail.
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back {D She has lived in for a long time in a valley,purifying the
water for the other creatures to drink from it.  Doing her usual
task,she was approched by a party of other creatures asking her what
she was doing.  "Its the honor of the gargoyales to purify the
water"she answered.  And this she went on doing till she heard of
something that could replace her...  She was bored of purifying the
water and for the first time of her life she prepared herself to see
the rest of the world of Thera.  She encountred many mobs in her way
and managed to kill them and defend herself against there attack. 
She liked the outside world and managed to survive there.  She made
many freinds along the way and traveled with them to practise her
skills.  She felt herself becoming more powerful every time she
trained.  She forgot that she was supposed to search for something
and she didnt really care.  She liked traveling and becoming a
powerful gargoyle warrior.  She became able to do many things she
wasnt able to do before.  Searching for equipment and killing for
survival became a routine of her daily life she enjoyed much.  The
gods Of Thera helped her and she was grateful to have them by her
side.  Sometimes,she finds herself after a dangerous and risky battle
in the hospital but she never gives up and returns to her adventures.
No matter how dangerous her life is she will survive...  So she
traveled to sanaria,her hometown and worked there as a merchandiser
selling different sorts of equipment for all kind of creatures.  She
soon was able to buy things she needed such as equipmenmt for her own
kind where she found in different towns and cities all over thera or
potions she needed during her travels with two companions and some
supplies.  She enjoyed this new way of living and liked earning gold
and silver coins.  Her big body allowed her to defend herself and
this makes her skills become even better each time.  She once killed
a drow and became wanted for it,prayed for the gods to forgive her
because he wasnt an ennemie but her travelling companion.  She didnt
know how she killed him but her prayers made him get well and he
forgave her.  But the gods never did untill someone killed her ; a
friend she asked to sacrificed her soul for them.  And so the gods
took her soul and gave her another one,a pure one...  And so this
incident forgotten,she traveled again in search of food,equipment and
of having her skills to the maximum level.
