Desc You lay your eyes on the most sexiest thing to ever grace
the land of Thera.  It is hard to distinguish between this felars
tail and... well, lets just say this appears to be a two-tailed felar.
Further inspection would say otherwise, but unless this felar
whips you in the face with his "second tail", or if you're lucky
enough to be that "special someone".

Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.
In fact, maybe nothing at all.  But that is not yet
said though maybe it is, but maybe it isn't.
Yet here you are asking around of this stranger,
yet why not ask the stranger himself?  Silly 
person.  Little is told of Setacus, except that he is
of the Horde.  He is a shadow rarely seen.
He was raised in the forest, stealing from homes.
If ever caught, Setacus would simply stab, and stab,
and stab.  For that matter.  Much blood lays on his fingers.
But that remains another story.  Magic users he does not
like, in fact he despises them.  Magic users, ugly and oogly,
shoould all be killed.  That is what Setacus stands for.  He also stands
for theft, as it is the way he makes his living.  Once it was told he stole
an entire town, though that can very easily be disputed.  Yet it has been said
to have happened.  At any rate, that is also another tale.  Much more could be said,
but it won't be said, so deal with it.  Because much more is too much more.
 
Farewell
Setacus
