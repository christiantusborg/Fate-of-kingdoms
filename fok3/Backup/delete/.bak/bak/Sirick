Desc Standing before you is a tall male felar.  He stands around 25
hands tall and weighs approximately 80 stones.  Sirick is hairy and
extremely agile.  His face is round, with deep bloodshot eyes that
glare around him constantly.  He has two large, prominent tatoos on
his arms.  These show lineage in the felar, signifying the length of
time he has spent on Thera.  Sirick's skin is a pale, sickly beige,
even paler than the skins of most felars.  He carries himself with a
confident air, as do most creatures of his strength and dexterity. 
On his hip he has several small belt pouches hanging from his belt,
as well as a large sword to slay his enemies with.

Back Little is known of Sirick and his history, all that I can tell you
are the rumors that are going around the local taverns.  Sirick
supposedly comes from the very old warriors guild, deep under some
ancient city of darkness.  He spent his childhood there, learning
from the outcasts and dregs of the underworld, and also honing his
skills as a warrior and swordsman.  He learned how to see things most
people couldn't, how to dodge, parry, block, and all the other skills
and abilities that are often necessary to survive in the oft
dangerous world of Thera.  Some believe that Sirick came out of the
city when it was savagely pillaged by an unknown group.  Sirick had
been out hunting at the time, and came back to his beloved if filthy
city to find only ashes, spirits, and the distinct odor of an ancient
enemy.  Since then, Sirick has wandered the realms of Thera,
searching for those who had destroyed his city.  During his travels,
Sirick has met many different people, some which were good, some bad.
Many of these fellow travelers taught Sirick important lessons and
useful skills, all of which Sirick added to his repertoire.  He has
gathered information about the movements, whereabouts, strengths, and
weaknesses about his foes, and is now training to move on his enemy. 
And when he does finally go up against his mortal enemies, he will
show them the same mercy that they showed on his beloved city.
