Desc {DA hulking creature stands before you, slobbing slightly in an unintelligent manner. Nearly 8 feet tall, the bulky
creature must weigh near 50 stone (1 stone = approx. 14 lbs.). While it is quite obvious that this creature
is a troll, there are some odd characteristics about this individual. Most apparent is the fact that his entire body
is covered in short, glossy, black hair. The skin which is exposed, is a dark grey, almost the color of charcoal.
 
The troll does not have the regular bulbous face of his species, instead he has an angular visage similar to that of
a felar. Within his apparently empty eye sockets, two flickering red flames can be seen, burning. 
Two bulging arms are attached to his barrel-like torso and end with inch long claws on each hand. His legs are equally
muscular and end in a pair of enormous, flat feet

Immtitle Immortal~
Back {DThe life of Darkness could dwarf the life of most, including many gods. Born long before the ascension of Lord
Kazmir into the realms of the immortal, Darkness began his life as an orphan.
 
After an unnaturally dark night, a young girl was wandering the grasslands surrounding her village when she happened
upon a small bag. Being the curious type she peeked inside and to her surprise she found a jet black kitten, 'mewing'
quietly. Happily taking the basket home, Darkness was given the name which would become one of the most feared. As
the girl's "kitten" began to grow, it became apparent that it was something more then just a cat. It grew incredibly
fast and had an intelligence similar to that of a human. Before the felar could reach the age of five, trouble would
cross his path. 
 
During a moonless night, a shadowy circus lumbered over the surrounding hills and set up on the outskirts of the
village. Innocently the girl brought her Darkness with her to view the circus, not fully aware of what attention
the dark felar would bring. The carnies seemed to whisper to each other when Darkness went by, but the girl was never
approached. A week after arriving at the village, the circus left as they had come... but this time they carried many
of the village's valuables with them, including the young felar. 
 
The carnival workers taught Darkness all their thieving ways, and the felar's natural dexterity and wit made him 
a quick learner and an excellent thief. Freak by day and thief by night, Darkness enjoyed his life for a time. Soon
though, the circus approached the great city of Sanaria and people were less guillable. When the circus attempted
to set up outside the great gates, it was quickly broken up. During the commotion, Darkness disappeared into the city
to make a name for himself.
 
Many years passed as the thieves guild grew with their felar guildmaster leading them on. No belongings were safe
from their agents and the cityguards were often to weak to face them in combat. Darkness was happy, yet still he 
wished for more power. An organization known as Kujikiri made itself known to the thief and he was quick to join their
ranks. Once again it was not long before he became their leader, as well as his thieves guild. Darkness felt completed
 
As was always the way, trouble found Darkness. The paladins of Gemma did not appreciate the pickpocketting ways of
Kujikiri and declared war upon the order. Many great battles were fought and many great warriors fell, but never
Darkness... As he stood quietly in the streets of Sanaria, observing he noticed a man spying upon him. Not thinking
too much of it, Darkness continued as he was. The sounds of hoofbeats startled the felar out of his thoughts and
to his dismay the great paladin Dalamar was charging down upon him. Once in his life Darkness was unlucky and stumbled
upon a beggar at his feet. One sweep of the paladin's great sword sliced Darkness clear in two. With his last breath
he reached for one of his rainbow potions but his breath was not long enough.
 
His spirit entering the void, Darkness madly prayed to any god which would hear him. Mephiston, god of Mischief heard
his pleas and once the are was cleared reunited Darkness with his body. From then on the felar was not as he had been.
A red light burned within his empty eye sockets and he no longer had the same thirst for power and leadership he
once had. Many decades past and still the creature did not age. Darkness became mostly a legend, perfecting his 
concealing skills and merely observing the world as he had enjoyed in true life. The thirst for power was weakened...
but not extinguished. 
 
With the ascension of new gods, Darkness prayed once again for a pact so he might regain some lust for life. The
being who answered him was not as good-willed as Mephiston. Darkness would be given a new form and new power... but
he must serve the dark lords. So the deal was made, Darkness' body was mutated into that resembling a troll and he
was granted the power of a defiler of good. His aged heart was never fully corrupted and so he remains, of free will
but constantly drawn to the wishes of evil.
