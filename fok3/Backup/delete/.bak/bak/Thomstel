Desc The drow before you looks like every other drow, dark of
complexion, almost a purple, with a bright white shock of a mane
falling down to either side of his narrow face.  High elven
cheekbones speak of his race's ancient bond to the surface elves, and
dark, mysterious eyes peer out from his stretched face.  He is slight
of build, but wiry, and likely he posseses a fair amount of strength
despite his size.  His hands seem very peculiar, very thin and
uncalloused, not like an adventurer's hands at all.  His movements
tell more of a story still.  Every motion is precise.  He seems as
though every effort has been calculated to minimize effort while
still obtaining the desired effect.  He carries himself in a manner
that speaks of his awareness of the world around him.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back The drow called Thomstel was named for a old warrior of yore, who
led his kingdom to much fame and riches.  Most records have forgotten
his exploits, but the drow retained the knowledge of the original
Thomstel's skills and power.  When the drow was born, he was
recognized as the fulfilment of a prophecy that would allow the drow
to gain much power in the surface world.  As a young child, Thomstel
was left aboveground to fend for himself, his drow parents confident
in the prophecy's assurance that he would flourish and grow strong
despite the normal drow aversion to the sun.  And so he did grow, and
became powerful and has found that the sun is but a hindrance to him
now.
 
As his power has grown, so has his knowledge of the world in which he
now lives. He has seen the horrors of war and beauty of simple pleasures,
beyond what a normal drow would be able to imagine. His calling has
brought him much reknown, but a great deal of indecision as well. As
he has succeeded in many of his endeavors, so has his heart been heavy
with the weight of prophecy. He has learned of another way to live, apart
from that which his parents and people could have envisioned for him. A
life free from their yoke.
 
Thomstel had obtained a temporary residence in Thalos, where he was tolerated,
if not well-known, among the people living there. His advetures took him to
the far corners of Thera, but he seemed to always return to Thalos for the
times between his treks. Then, disaster struck. Some dark event destroyed
much of what the people of Thera had built and accomplished. Many were killed,
in Thalos and elsewhere, but a few survived. Thomstel was one such survivor.
Together with the previously mistrustful villagers of Thalos, the dead were
buried and the rubble cleared away. He performed many a task for the village,
including travelling for supplies and information from the world outside the
town. Once the rebuilding itself had begun, however, the village began to view
him more and more in their mistrustful ways. He was not permitted to teach
the children how to defend themselves from creatures of the surrounding woods.
He was told that a drow on the new city council might upset some. He was eyed
with suspicion when he mentioned a wall around the city proper. His application
to join the city militia was denied. Things were reverting back to their pre-
catastrophe times, and Thomstel decided, reluctantly, that his presence was
not needed, or wanted, in Thalos now that things were turning for the better.
 
Taking up his blade and dagger once more, he set out. To look for a new home,
and find others who might accept him for the person he was, not as the drow
he appeared to be. His room in Thalos waits for him, for a few there told him
he was welcome anytime, but he knows that such a permanent home is not in his
fate.
