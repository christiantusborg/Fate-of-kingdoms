Immtitle Immortal~
Back Boqus Bodenhaise was born in the city of Sanaria. He was born 
 
into a wealthy family of dwarves. His father, Elnsberg Bodenhaise 
worked as a merchant and earned a lot of money that way. Until 
Boqus was 17 he lived in a big mansion with his parents and 
brother, Borus. Borus and Boqus was twins and best friends. When 
Boqus was 11, Skaiku and his mother moved in. Skaiku was Boqus 
and Borus friend, and when Skaiku lost his father he needed help. 
The Bodenhaise family was know for its friendlyness so Skaiku and 
Skaiku's blind mother moved in.
When Boqus was at the age of 17 Skaiku started acting strange. It 
all ended with Skaiku setting fire to the Bodenhaise mansion. 
Boqus' parents died in the fire together with Borus and Skaiku's 
mother. Boqus has no evidence that Skaiku did it, but he did 
suspect him. But Boqus passed into a time of deep depression and 
didn't say anything.
When Boqus was 20 he decided he had to do something with his 
life. He was quite rich, after inheritaging the entire Bodenhaise 
fortune. He wanted vengeance on the evil that has taken from him 
his beloved family, so he became a Paladin, a knight of goodness,
and roamed the world in search for evil to destroy. And he never
again spoke to the evil Skaiku, who became a filthy thief of pure
evil!
