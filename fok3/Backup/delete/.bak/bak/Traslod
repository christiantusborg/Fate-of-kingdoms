Desc Floating before you is the young pixie named Traslod.
His frame is a bit sturdier than most pixies, but his
pink eyes have the same curiosity and playful nature
that is common in most pixies.  When he notices you
approaching, he stiffens up into a more "noble"
posture.  His arms are still thin, but his fingers
seem to move, almost unconsciosly into the workings
of various spells.  His smile is large and warm as
he finally distinguishes what you are.  Traslod
adjusts his somewhat old and outdated clothing, 
in an attempt to look somewhat more presentable.
He then runs his hands through his long, silver
hair, in a feeble attempt as some grooming.  There
is something about him that is reminisant of the
stories of mages who lock themselves away in towers
to study magic.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Traslod is very open about where he comes from and his past.
He was born in Sanaria, how long ago he never mentions, and  
from a very young age he was curious about the lands outside
of his homeland.  This curiosity did not stop with that 
alone.  He was walking down the street one day with his 
mother, and saw a group of men walking down the street.  The
three men were what are sometimes called "adventurers".  He
had never seen the likes of these men before.  One was tall,
nearly seven feet tall (a giant to young Traslod) and was
wearing heavy armor and carrying a large axe.  A second
man, who was not as tall, was wearing armor as well, but
carried a mace with him instead.  The final man caught
the eye of young Traslod the most however.  This man seemed
to glow.  There was a shimmering about his form that entranced
the young pixie.  He asked his mother why the man shimmered
the way he did.  His mother looked down at him and explained
that the man was a mage and told him all about magic and the
past of pixies.  When Traslod became old enough to do as he
pleased, he began to study magic.  He learned that several
types of magic existed.  He was drawn to magical items however.
Years past, and Traslod kept studying his magic.  One early
morning he felt as if there was nothing more that he
could learn by simple study alone.  So he decided to go out
into the world and become and adventurer so he could learn
all that he can learn about the ways of the alchemist.
