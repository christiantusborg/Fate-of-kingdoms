Desc What exactly is beauty?  What does ugly mean?  I mean every one is
beautiful to someone.  Admitedly some people appearbeautiful to more
people than others do, and Mhyrtyn certainly isnt one of those. 
Traditionally it is said that no matter how bad you look you mother
will still think youre beautiful.  Lets just say Mhyrtyn ISNT
traditional.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Mhyrtyn knows little of his own background, the problem is that
his memory isnt very good.  Giants are generally thought of as being
a little, well, stoopid, this is not always the case.  Infact
Mhyrtyns great great great grandfather was a reknowned poet, famous
for his poem "wen da rocks aint as big as der uver rocks dat used to
be ere" in which he addresses many of the existential and esoteric
problems of being a giant in a world of little people.  So Mhyrtyns
family had quite high hopes for him, however he did not quite live up
to them.  The only thing he really showed any interest in was hitting
things, though it should be said that he was (and indeed still is)
really quite good at it.  Still his parents were hopeful and sent him
to the highly secretive Giants Academy of the Arts (GAA for short,
and by coincidence also the most used giant battle cry) but he just
didnt fit in.  He was too ugly to be an actor and too stupid to do
anything else, and so after less than a single term he was sent home.
But afraid to face the disapointment of his parents Mhyrtyn ran away,
and so now he wanders around trying to find a way to make his parents
proud of him.  It didnt take very long to discover his one true
natural talent, and that was hitting things hard with various other
things.  His size gives him quite an advantage in this, but it is
more than just that, it is an innate love of hitting things.  However
this has left him with a bit of a dilema, although he is very good at
it he is sure that his parents would not approve, they would probably
claim that he is merely reinforcing stereotypes, and they never
approve of those.  So despite finally finding an activity that makes
him truly happy Mhyrtyn is not happy, cos he now has to try to find
some kind of compromise that will please his parents.  After much
thought Mhyrtyn realised that possibly his parents greatest
disappointment wasnt when he crippled his grandmother, but the fact
that he had never learned to read or write (which had always stood in
the way of him becoming a poet) so he decided to do something to put
that right.  However being a realistic sort of person he realised it
would be a waste of time trying to learn to read and write now,so he
did the next best thing.  He found someone considerably smaller than
him self that could already read and write.  One day while walking
near Sanaria he came across a comunity of small "fluttery" people who
seemed to be literate.  So using his very best diplomatic skills
(stomping on people till no one was complaining anymore) he found a
volunteer to read and write for him, and so a whole new world began
to open up for mhyrtyn.
