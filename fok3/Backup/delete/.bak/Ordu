Desc The male Felar you see before you is an excellent specimen of the
physical qualities of his race.  Standing a good bit above the head
of a human, a fine coat of stone gray hair covers his body.  Long
slender, and well defined arms sprout from broad shoulders, ending in
finely manicured claws.  A pair of yellow, elipsical eyes seem to
glow slighty, placed evenly on his rounded face.  Sharply pointed
ears twitch slightly.  And a thin braided tail, adorned with a small
bell, swishes softly behind him.  Yet as sturdy and ferocious as this
creature may appear.  His demeanor holds a touch of serenity and
peace.  As his expressions remain hidden.  F

Back Researching the story of Ordu, you learn that he is a Felar.  Born
in some unknown lands.  People speak of his youth as turbulent.  His
parents forced to travel lightly and quickly.  And rumors abound that
the boy was troublesome and wayward for a time.  Light thefts and
childhood troubles, yet his mostly home taught education never
faltered.  When his parents finally settled in a small town where
they were both employed, they sent Ordu to a near by Monastery where
he might learn more of the world and times around him.  The boy , at
first a disciplinary problem, soon found his cravings for excitement
in the books he read, and the legends and tales he committed to
memory.  The young Felar's physical prowess was easily able to adapt
to the strict daily calinstenic routine of the monks.  Upon the day
of his Manhood, Ordu announced to his family that he would be
entering the order proper.  Since, as the story goes with most young
Acolytes, Ordu is said to be travelling the lands, proving his
penitence.
