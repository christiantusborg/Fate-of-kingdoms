Desc Standing before you is a tall lean female Drow elf.  Her slender
body is curved and shapely, her muscle tones are well defined, and
add to her feminine figure.  Her long white mane is pulled tightly
back in a ponytail high upon her head.  Her well defined, and
flawless face looks like it was carved out of a section of onyx.  Her
shimmering eyes glow red, showing the many years of her life thus
far.  She is dressed in mostly dark colored clothing, and covers it
all up with a long black cloak.  She does not burden herself with
many items, as if she is always on the move.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Valice was born like all drow in the UnderDark.  She had come from
one of the many lower houses in Ud.  You know the ones, the ones that
are never heard of.  She wanted more out of life, more than she could
get out of becomeing a High Priestess of Lloth in such a low house. 
Not being to good at the arts of the Preistess anyway, she spent her
time training in the arts of the assassin in her free time.  Waiting
for the right time when she could fake her death and get out of the
UnderDark.  She had it all planned out she had grabbed a lesser male
drow and told him to meet her at a cliff, the cliff.  The one that
was used to destroy non-followers of Lloth, the one filled with the
dreaded Driders.  She told him to wait by the east cavern and be
hidden, she had something special for him.  She had something for him
alright, he was going to be her scap goat to get out of the
UnderDark.  When the time was right she brought with her another
female of the house, one of the lesser females, but a female non the
less, and she knew that she would be believed.  So she told the other
female to wait there while she went to check something out for a
minute.  The female of lesser standard listened of course and waited
there for her to return.  She then walked over to the male and
teassingly tempted him into closeing his eyes, so that she might give
him what he came out here to get.  The male full of himself and
wanting whatever he could get from the sexy female, closed his eyes. 
She then lightly kissed him on the lips and slipped her dagger
inbetween the back of the males ribs, and into the lungs, so he could
not scream.  She then pussed the bright eyes male into the cliff and
screamed out in pain.  So that the other female would come over to
see what was going on.  All she seen though was a prone form on the
ground getting torn apart buy the dreaded driders.  Of course in
terror she ran back to Valice's house to report the news.  Valice had
got her opening and headed for the surface world to see what it had
to offer to her.
