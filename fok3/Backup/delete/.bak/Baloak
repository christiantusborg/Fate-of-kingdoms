Desc Here is Baloak.
a average sized elf with the normal
blue eyes.  He wears armor that is
black with gold trim that extedns on the sides
and curl up.(looks like megaman x's armor but with
the typed diff.)
there are pices of the original orb forged into the armor
allowing him to move where he wants to and some power.
he has a worn green band on his right arm.
he has a cloak covering his left side.
the cloak is a deep green with a golden
string running though the ends of the cloak

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Baloak is the one from a portal.  The one that left his world
He came here to run away from his planet that was being attacked
although he didnt want to come here. something made him
while here in the beginning he hid his armor so he wouldn't 
stand out so much.  But as the world became more threating
and the monsters started to come to this world he had to find his
armor.  Before he could look for the armor he fell though a portal
He was at his own planet again. where he found the orb.
Baloak studied the orb for months.  Three months.  
When its secrets where shown it became a transport.
It took Baloak to the place of his armor and his weapon.
Baloak thought it would be a good idea to use the orb
as a defence item. By moving the whole city to a different 
place.  No body took the idea.  
Baloak also made many copys of the orb. Most of them exploded
there are six orbs which Baloak keeps on himself.
The original was shattered by Baloak and forged into his armor
so Baloak could use a portal any time.  But the core of the orb
was used for a bolt for his weapon , a crossbow.  
Baloak left to his home world.... to save it. 
After a long time Baloak came back and was recrutied by a 
Gondor under ground. 
(the rest is in rp notes of after pwipe)
Baloak is now a part of the group formed by Afgar and Kenon.
Baloak is the man of magic and science with in the three leaders.
but Baloak dosn't seem to really be liking how things are being done
by Afgar and Kenon.
