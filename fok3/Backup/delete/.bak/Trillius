Desc {xAs you look on Trillius you see nothing significant.  He is a
tall pale skinned human with {yb{Yl{yo{Yn{yd{Ye{x hair and eyes of a
{bp{Bale blu{be{x.  He carries himself as a warrior.  A weapon at his
side.  He walks on the balls of his feet, ready to dodge any attack
or to leap to the defense of those who need it.  His eyes scan the
room weighing each and every person in the room.  After taking in the
entire room he relaxes noticably and winks at you knowingly and
smiles in greating.

Back {xYour search for information regarding Trillius is futile.  As
you search the library archives and ask the tavern patrons you get no
information.  No matter how long you search, no one has record of or
remembers him.  Then just as you are about give up a small child
approaches you and tugs on your tunic.  {G"Heya...  Heya mister I
heared you are asking about Trillius."  {x he says to you.  He
continues, {G"I'll tell you all I know.  No one knows who his parents
were, but I think it Dermos just created him.  All I know is that
back when he was little he started the Lost Boys gang in northeastern
Sanaria.  They aren't a regular gang though, they did good stuff. 
They went and helped out the guards and stuff, polishing armor and
learning things from them.  Him and the bigger Lost Boys protected
the little kids from bullies, thieves, and slavers.  Then Rault
offered to teach him the sword so he could be a cityguard.  That's
when he turned the Lost Boys over to Feris the big kid who protects
us little Lost Boys now.  He went to Rault and learned all kinds of
neat things.  He joined the cityguard for a while, but then decided
that Sanaria was well protected and that he wanted to go fight things
and bring many more under his wing of protection.  He comes back and
visits us sometimes though.  He sends the best of us to Rault and the
others to get trained in whatever we want to learn.  He even pays for
it all.  He's my hero, when I grow up I want to be just like him." 
{x With that the boy turns and disappears back into the crowd without
a trace.  As you turn away you notice that your purse string has been
cut, but none of the coins are missing.  Was this just a clever story
to distract you or is their truth to the childs tale?
