Desc Before you stands the rather huge Felar named Dras, he has neck
long ebony black hair with some white stripes which is set up with a
band, and his eyes have a gentle glow with yellow that lightnes you
up.  His body is kinda muscelar and well trained which shows on some
of tha nasty looking scars on his body after he has been fighting. 
When all comes to all you see Dras as a humble and kind Felar.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back When Dras was born his parents were surprised, he was not quite
like all other Felars, his eyes and hair was different, his eyes was
blessed with a glow form the power of magic as his family was about
to find out.  As a child Dras was sendt to a school for monks, and
they soon discowerd that he had special abilitys to learn combat
skills and use magic, when Dras grew older he went back home after
spending 10 years on the school.  When Dras came home he found his
house burned down to the ground, smoke was still rising from the
ruins.  He found his mother hung up in a tree whit nails through her
hands and feet, she was still alive when he found her.  Dras used all
the spells he knew in hope of restoring his beloved mother, his
father was crucified in the middle of their corn field He used many
hours to find herbs that could restore him fully even though he was
not sure he could restore him either.  He sucseded to restore his
father with only leaving some scars and bruses on him, but his mother
died a few weeks later.  He then asked his father what happend and
who did it.  Some of the worst clans of the dreaded black knights had
attacked them because they did not want them to stay on their
property, so they gathered all their powers and swept the house and
all its belongings, they stole every thing he said, and they did take
every thing, Dras was so angry but yet only disapointed to find out
that someone could do such horrible things.  He then descided to
fight for justice and good for the rest of his life.  On some of his
first adventures he meets alot of nice, some creepy, some evil
fiends, but most of them did understand him because som had
experienced the same thing.  On his mission to defeat all evil he
meats Jorlak and some other guys that help him on his quest, they
realy gives him the feeling of that noone dislikes him in this world
and it gives him the strength to continue even if it gets tough.
