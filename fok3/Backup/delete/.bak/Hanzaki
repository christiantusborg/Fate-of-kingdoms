Back Little is known of this strange newcomer.  Hanzaki was born is a
great city called Seldum.  His parents gave him the name Hanzaki
because of the The Great Legendary Druid and once a Leader of The
Kingdom of Lurai after Legolas left they kingdom.  His parents always
talked to him about Hanzaki The Legendary Druid and all the great
things he has done for the whole world.  Little Hanzaki always
dreamed of becoming like The Legendary Druid and was sure he will be
someday.  Everyday,he would train to become powerfull non-stop as his
parents supported him.  He had great friends that trained with him. 
Shadrim,Legolas,Locke and Hesper.  When Hanzaki grew old enough to
travel,he left his humble domain and city and went in to the wild
with his friends.  Many days passed,even month,as they traveled
together,walking thought forests,water,deserts and cities.  After a
while,Legolas and Locke Left on their own and only Shadrim and Hesper
was left with him.  Everyday,when Hanzaki woke up in the morning,he
thought of The Legendary Druid and wondered how he looked like and
how powerful he was.  He wanted to become like him no matter what. 
He trained and trained while Shadrim and Hesper trained with him. 
Later on,they found this big city called Sanaria, they decided to
rest there for a hile and get some supplies.  After that,they moved
to another city called New Thalos and continued there adventure. 
They stay in New Thalos for a while and then continued traveling. 
While they were walking in the desert , Hanzaki heard a chirp form
Looking up , he saw a bird holding a note,the bird approched him ,
droped the note and flew away.  He wondered what it could be...  He
opened the note and read it.  "Dear Hanzaki, Our friend Locke has
left us...  No one knows how it happened..  I was obligated to send
you this to inform you because you have the right to know...  So
there it is..  May the God be with him."  The note was note signed by
anyone..  But he guessed it was Legolas, Sad to hear the news ,
Hanzaki weapt for his friend Locke and prayed the Gods to lead him in
heaven.  After that Hanzaki decided to travel alone and to fullfill
his dreams alone as The Legendary Druid did.  They respected his
decision and left him.  He trained and trained harder and harder then
he ever did before.  He could even feel his skill improving...  Until
one day...  While he was sleeping,he had a deam...  A strange
dream...  A shining light approching him as he stared with eyes wide
open..  A old elf appeared , he knew it him...  Hanzaki {W{DThe
{WL{Degendary {WD{Druid{x..  He flew by him and sat close to him. 
Pating his sholder,he said "Ahh...  Hanzaki" with a smile.  Mouth and
eyes wide open , a word couldn't come out from his mouth as he
started at him.  The legenday druid told him that he has surpassed
his knowlege and skills and told him not to precipitate thing
