Desc Ahead you can see a dark shadow moving about.  As you inch closer
you notice that it is a strange looking fellow.  His {Ddark {rred{B
eyes shimmer in the light of the moon.  He has {Dgrey{Bhair that
sways with the cool night breeze.  He wears a very dark cloak which
stretches from his neck to his shiny black boots.  This cloak hides
his body and anything that he may carry.  He wears a pitch {Dblack{B
hood that hangs over his eyes to cover up any facial expression he
may make.  From the looks of the figure it stands about 5 foot tall
and weighs near 123 stones.

Back {C"Hey", you hear coming from a man down the road.  {B"What do you
want", you reply.  {C"Would you like to hear a story", says the old
man.  {B"Ummm....  Sure, why not", you reply in wonder.  {C"Alright,
where do I start?"  , answers the old man.  {C"Ahh, yes", says the
old man and then he begins.  {G There is a young warrior known as
Eirion.  He has travelled through this town many times.  And each
time he seems to bring more news of his travels.  He has told much of
his story to date.  This is what has been told.  Eirion grew up in a
small house in the woods.  He was born into a big family of 13
people.  He was the youngest of all of his brothers and sisters. 
This proved to be the only thing that kept him alive.  When he was
the age of 7 his house was raided by a band of rogue warlocks.  They
all used different sorts of magics to hold his family still why they
were slaughtered.  Eirion was hidden by his mother in a small cabinet
when the rogues first broke in.  And after 2 days eirion finally got
the nerve to come out and what he saw was his whole family
slaughtered.  This sent Eirion into a rage.  He stormed through the
forest in search of the people that had killed his family.  And soon
enough he caught up with the band of rogues.  When he found them
without thinking he jumped into their camp and started swinging his
tiny dagger around uncontrolably.  He wounded one or two of them and
then was put under a sleep spell.  He wasnt killed but was kept
asleep for 10 years.  When he awoke he swore to stop the use of magic
and he then began to train in the arts of weapons.  And that lead him
to Sanaria where he has been training for the past year.  After
training his skills for a year he went in search of the rogues that
killed his family.  While looking for the magic-using rogues Eirion
stumbled upon some people that soon became his allies.  Eirion met up
with Vetacus and his brother Zetacus and they explained to him that
they too wanted to find and slay people that use magics.  So Eirion
began to hunt with his new friends and allies for the evil rogues. 
After staying around them for some time Eirion grew fond of them. 
And soon they told him about a group that they were forming.  This
group was to be called the {YH{yO{DR{yD{YE{G.  They told Eirion about
how the this group was a band of warriors and none magic users that
were out to destroy magic from Thera.  So Eirion jumped at the chance
to join them.  Eirion saw this as his one chance to join people that
would help him find and slay the evil rogues that murdered his family
all those years ago.
