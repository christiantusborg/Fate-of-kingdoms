Desc This creature is clearly a Felar, having the appearance of a leopard.
By the creature's size and build, it appears to be male.  As all
other sentient creatures do, it stands upright on its hind legs
and has hands with dexterous fingers, but that is where the
similarities end.  Both hand and foot bare claws the size of daggers.
The creature is quite large, standing a good six and a half paces
and weighing roughly two hundred forty stones.  He is in exquisite
physical condition, having colossal upper body muscles, a lean
stomach, and immense legs.  Although he stands upright, he stands
with hind legs slightly bent, as if ready to sprint at a moments
notice.  The leopard-like Felar has a golden coat covered in small
black spots.
 
The beast's face, like the rest of his body, has a golden coat
with the occasional black spot.  Two triangular, pointed ears
point skyward, listening to all around him.  His eyes resemble
smooth spheres of amber with cores of obsidian.  A snout extends
roughly a quarter pace from the eye sockets, a small brown nose
at the end.  The Felar hold perfectly still and seems to carry
himself with pride.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back Arcius was born the eldest male in a litter of 6 cubs.  His pack
of Felar was quite small, the dozen or so men roamed the plains
as highwaymen while the women remained in homesteads at forest's
edge, raising the cubs.  When Arcius was still an infant, well
before his recollection, the men of the pack foolishly approached
a mercenary group of trolls with hopes of robbing them.  Ten Felar
warriors entered the fight, ten Felar warriors were left for the
vultures.  After days without hearing from Arcius' father, his
mother sent Arcius and his siblings to a small human monastery on
the far side of the forest.  There, the clerics took all six cubs
and reared them as their own.
 
Years past as Arcius and his siblings were taught religious doctrine.
The Felar new they were different than the humans of the monastery,
but they respected them all as if they were parents.  Not once did
any question what they were doing in such a strange location.  They
continued their studies with the clerics and began to learn curative
magics.  It seemed as if this new generation of Felar would live a
peaceful and happy existence, nothing like that of their father.
 
Then, when Arcius was roughly twenty years of age, he and his
litter were sent to give relief to a nearby elven village that had
reportedly been attacked by an unknown force.  When the Felar
arrived, they found the village in ruin.  Ancient trees were felled
at the trunks, houses were aflame, and bodies littered the streets.
The Felar searched through the wreckage for survivors but found
none, and their weak curative magics could by no means revive the
dead.  For nearly a week they searched for signs of life, but to
no avail.  Finally, the Felar returned to the monastery to report
what had happened, only to discover it too was attacked while they
were gone!  The once grand monastery had been reduced to rubble,
giant tapestries were bathed in blood, and the remains of the
clerics were scattered about.  This sight was too much for Arcius.
He ran from that place as fast as he could, leaving his siblings
behind.  He ran from dusk to dawn until he reached the vast plain
of his youth, the home he was too young to remember.  It is then
that his instincts took over and told him that he should remain there.
 
For five years, Arcius lived a solitary life on the open plain.
He was haunted by the fate of the clerics, and blamed himself for
not being able to protect them.  Every day he trained himself in
the ways of combat.  He abandoned the ways of modern man, instead
opting to hone his instincts.  He returned to the ways of his
ancestors, the great cats, becoming a skilled fighter with his
natural gift, his claws.  While doing this, he continued his
practice of curative magic and other religious doctrine.  He vowed
that never again would his lack of skill result in harm to others.
 
It has been less than one month since Arcius left the plain.
The Felar has not forgotten the clerics.  He continues to train
in both combat and curative magics.  He currently remains in
the Sanaria area, living off the land and helping all he comes across.
