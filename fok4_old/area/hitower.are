Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

The chamber of darkness~
You are in a vast chamber. The walls fade into darkness, leaving you
with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room. Swirling here and
there in the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in your
light and leave it that much darker here.

Torture chamber~
You are in an ill lit chamber. Instruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own. An operating table is here, though it is bare.
  An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.

The inner chamber~
You are in a small dark chamber. Upon the walls are glowing sigils of
dark power, scrawled and traced in an evil language no longer known to most
of this plane of existence. There is an obsidian altar here which seems to
glow, but does not shed any light, in fact it seems to be taking light in.

A bright hallway~
You are in a long well lit hallway leading east and west. The walls here
are a milky white color, and glow with a warm luminescence, as does the
floor. A feeling of goodness permeates the area, and you feel unworthy to
tread upon these sacred floors.

An antechamber~
You are in a small antechamber. It is well lit here, though the source
of light cannot be seen. It is almost as if the room itself exudes a warm
glow of goodness. A larger chamber can be seen to the west, but you do not
feel worthy to pass into it.

The chamber of the white light~
You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an unknown
metallic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.

the walls, and the floor is covered with a plush multicolored carpet, which
seems to rustle and move at the touch of your boots.

The audience chamber~
You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.

glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
the fact that it ends in a blinding blue light to the west. On hooks set
into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy of a evacuation.

In the light~
You seem to be floating in a magical energy field, though you cannot see
the source of the energy, you can feel its power pushing at you from all
sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
  An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be an
exit.
