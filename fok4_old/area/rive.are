Andus looks like a scribe.  As a matter of fact, last summer, he
appeared on the scrolls advertizing the Scribe's Convention, held in

have it built by getting rich patrons to support it.  He is the
curator.  He decides what works are added to the library's shelves. 
He also coordinates the library's small scriptorium.  He looks at
you, in passing, and you see that he hopes that you don't run amok in
his library, stealing and destroying his books.  But, if you do,
that's what the scriptorium is for.

Journal Entry 27
 
Tryna, your new mission is to examine all of Gondor's cities'
fortifications.
Yes M'lord.
A new job just in the middle of my training to become a better
spy!
I decided to make it a bit more interesting and coincide with
my training.
Zebania, you are to join me on my mission.
Zebania is a new recruit into Gondor. I explained to him what the
mission was.
This is how it will be done. You will ride ahead and warn the
city that a spy is supposedly going to infiltrate their city.
I will be the spy and I will try to slip through their guards using
no violent means, naturally.
Yes Ma'am.
We leave at dawn, gather your things and say your goodbyes as
we shall not return for some time.
Much to my suprise Zebania had few questions and followed my
orders quickly and to the point. Now I must pack my things and
get some sleep before the journey.

page~
The following exert (page) is from the book "Meeting the King," by
Tacar.  The page is brown with age, and a rough edge is on the left
hand side where it has been torn from a book.
 
 
Tacar followed the tall elven guard through the entrance to the town.
It had been a while since Tacar had last visited this glorious place.
He glanced around.  He could just see one of the new garrison houses of
Gondor- a couple of their guards stood outside to keep the city
protected. The sun had come up about an hour previous, and the town 
was now teemed with life.  Young elven children wore bright clothes and
ran down the street dodging the shoppers and guards. To the south, 
Tacar saw the high hedges of one of the beautiful gardens of Elvandor
where the high elves spent their time contemplating and thinking about
the town and people. 
 
The tall guard was led into one of the older houses.  It looked
deserted, but the two guards who stood opposite the house looked
far better trained than the rest of the guards in the city.
They were obviously watching this house. Turning his attention back to
his escort, Tacar realized he had missed something as the guard 
beckoned him to follow and disappeared through a new hole in the wall.
Following blindly, Tacar reached into his pocket.  The elf did
not require light.  His sharp eyes easily penetrated the gloom,
but Tacar felt far more comfortable being able to see himself.
Tacar twisted his small globe, activating the magic inside it, 
and lighted the whole corridor. The corridor was quite short
and dank.  The light could not quite penetrate the deep gloom, 
but the corridor seemed to lead off in two directions, the
east and west. The guard again beckoned, wanting Tacar to 
hurry. 
 
Towards the end of the corridor, Tacar's globe began to 
flicker with its power nearly gone. Tacar shook it to try and get 
some more light out of it, and the elf turned and said, "Do not 
worry, you will not need the light in a few seconds," and began 
climbing an old ladder.
 
At the top of the ladder lay a beautiful sight.  Trees and flowers
grew everywhere, and elves were tending to all the life in this
great reserve.  The guard led towards the center of the reserve and 
through the trees.  Tacar could make out the bulk of a huge 
dragon.
 
The guard approached the dragon, grinned, and whispered something in
its ancient ear.  It gave a toothy grin, and lowered its neck.  The elf
jumped on the back of the dragon, and pulled himself up to the
center.  Being careful, Tacar pulled himself up to a sitting position
behind the guard. As soon as Tacar was seated, the elf tapped the dragon.

bark~
Scared into tree bark, in elven characters, reads the
following-
 
 
  Imrahil was up in a tree hiding, always hiding, running
from hiding place to hiding place, never resting, always
dodging some unseen enemy.  This is the sum of Imrahil's
life over the past few days.  Since he had been here, he
had only been able to find streams enough to give him water
to drink and small game enough for food.  He was tired.
Phyically tired.  Tired of running and hiding.
  Below him a shape moved, tracking him.  It had not taken
Imrahil long to figure out that it could not climb.   He
still had no clue what it was, but if there was ever any
doubt that it was tracking him, it was erased then and
there.  
  Imrahil hopped out of the tree and ran on to his next
hiding place, stopping just long enough to grab a handful
of dirt and smearing it over his face and arms, trying
to further darken them to make hiding easier.
  Run, hide, run, hide.  Primal survival instinct had
taken over - it had no other choice - and survive he would
until he could face the thing down and defeat it...

My search for the Commander.
 
I was given my orders by Afgar to go explore the area near Neo city.  I 
departed from the group soon after we left Gerighelm.  Accompaning me 
were two other rangers from Gondor named John and James.  We made our 
way quickly and quietly through the forest towards Neo.  As we 
approached the west side of Neo we stopped to take our bearings in the 
pale light of a half moon.  I pointed to James and then to the north.  
I pointed to John and then to the south.  I pointd to myself and then 
east.  We head off in each of our directions towards the town.
 
As I approached the town of Neo, I noticed that the town was very quiet 
and dark.  As I neared the outer wall of the town I heard nothing.  The 
town was run down to begin with, but the town looked worse than usual. 
I scaled the west wall of the city with ease.  The old watch towers 
were not in use.  As I preceeded down the back alley I noticed no one. 
I did not even see a bum, which is common.  An eerie feeling overcame 
me as I wondered the dark alley toward the main part of town.  I came 
to the market, and it was not a pretty site.  The market should be
empty at night, but the stands were destroyed and the area smelled of
 
James and John appeared after a moment of observing the seen.  Both 
reported seeing nothing.  It seemed the town was deserted.  The three 
of us split up and search every building.  We found nothing, not even 
other living creatures.  The strange thing was that there seemed to be 
no signs of violence on the ground or within structures.
 
We left through the main gate out the east side of town for the 
rendezvous point.

Beneath the Leaves of Restoration~
That tree's have the power to restore is not a myth, but a fact. 
The elves of Rivendell, in attempt to make the abstract the obvious,
grew this tree from a seed presented to them by Gods from the
heavens, thus producing the tree of restoration.  The leaves from
this tree create a warmth and refreshment, and filter the evil.  A
pointed eared elf walks about tending, prunning, and taking over-all
care of the tree.  She is the caretaker of the tree, and thus the
caretaker of the tree's users.  To the south lies the hollow trunk
staircase which leads to the forest floor.

lies to the north, the trainer to a bend eastward, and the skill

A small meadow lies in all directions, to the east, to the west,
to the north, and to the south.  The great tree of restoration has
been kept by the elves, and thus the wildlife around the tree have
flourished.  The hollow trunk of the tree is around and the roots
from this tree have entwined with one another to form steps going to
the top of the tree.  The market of Rivendell lies in a southern
direction.  
Young Ones:  It is told from elven myth that a feather from the

West Market of Rivendell~
A bubbling spring fountain lies to the east.  The red brick path
below is coated in a thick mat of red and gray moss that grows due to
the heavy rain content of the forest.  A small city building lies to
the south where one can deposit money for safe keeping.  
 
Green ivy overspreads a wooden door to the south.

A Hollow Tree - Magic Store~
The bark like steps that lead to the top of this hollow tree
suddenly stop to combine together and form a floor.  On this floor a
huge mushroom grows where the shop keeper shows off some of his
magical items.  Sparkling mushrooms grow on the sides of the tree
like thousands of scales.  There is a moist rotting smell all around.
The ground, unlike the mushroom covered walls, is coated in a dank
black moss.  The moss, although looking slippery, makes for a very
carpeted room.  The bark stairs lead down.

Thick with moisture, the humid air tires the body in an ungainly
amount of time.  Mountain steep rock lies to the north, east, and
south.  Climbing is near impossible.  Tree trunk after tree trunk can
be seen westward.  A green mist begins to form.

The Seilo Jungle~
Surrounded on all sides by thick vegetation, the only source of
light that comes thru is by the Gods demand.  Orchids, perfuming the
air with sweet fragrance, dangle lazily from the branches above. 
Will-o-wisps danger this nightly environment, reeking annoying havoc
to stray travellers.

The Seilo Jungle~
Steep cliff walls jut upward to the south and west, and the wall
base disappears into the soggy marsh like ground.  Thick ivy coats
the surrounding area.  Lizards and other ivy loving animals dart
about- eating and playing- living.

circular mushrooms form steps up the trees- a perfect place for

With the elapse of time, tiny tree seeds have sprouted into giant
trees large enough to walk into or live.  Green foliage twists up the
trees.  A mist, ankle high, makes the ground cover and the floor
foliage flowers invisible.  A large mountain wall lies to the east,
and the expanse of the forest lies in all other directions.

vibrant white color that contrasts against the black earth.  Fissured
as far to the sky as the clouds sprout, a speckled mountain, forming
a wall, lies to the north.

after tree truck is all that is visible.

The Seilo Valley Mountains~
The narrow foot path continues upward and downward.  The black
rock is smooth from use.  The fertile Seilo Valley can be seen to the
south.  The canopy of trees seem to stretch on for ever.  Far in the
distance mountains can be seen with mist swirled at the base.  An
occasional bird can be seen gliding in the air above.

Elvei Rain Forest^ A Detached and Preserved Rain Forest~
All the lingering beauty of these jungles conspire to charm one
into staying here forever.  The smell of decaying wood sits on the
florest floor like a thick fog.  Birds and animals screech delight. 
Rarely do shafts of sunlight touch the forest floor, for the canopy
is heavily foliaged.

The Foyer of the Fay Library~
Within this stone room, the foyer of the library, there are woven
mats on the floor for sitting on, laying on, and relaxing on. 
Towards the front of the hall, there is a small platform with the
only chair in the room.  The acoustics in the room amplify the sound
from the platform, and dampen any other noises that may find their
way in.  On the east wall is a door formed so that when it closes, no
line is visible, and it doesn't interrupt the sound quality of the
room.  There is another like it on the north wall.  Both lead into
the library proper.

The Fay Library~
Gray stones make up the interior of the library- the walls, floor,
and columns.  The library is a substantial structure.  Sturdy
mahogany shelves line the walls.  Colorful slivers of bookcovers
stare out from the bookshelves.  People sit at tables, studying the
texts they have found here, while others prefer to borrow them to
read at their leisure.  The door to the south leads back to the
Foyer.  To the east, the library continues.

The Fay Library~
Pillars of stone jut from the center of the room, and ivy growing
from round painted pots grows up the groved columns.  Crafted out of
stone the library is a substantial structure.  Sturdy mahogany
shelves line the walls.  Colorful slivers of bookcovers stare out
from the bookshelves.  People sit at tables, studying the texts they
have found here, while others prefer to borrow them to read at their
leisure.  The library continues to the south and west.

to borrow them to read at their leisure.  Whatever you choose to do,
this is your library.  Make use of its resources as you will.  The
door to the west leads back to the Foyer.  To the north, the library
continues.

The Foyer- Fay Bank~
The bank continues to the east and north.  Beneath one's feet, the
ground is made of white glossy bricks.  The bricks are cut in squares
and have been placed with perfection.  A ceramic pot full of an
assortment of orchids can be seen hanging to the east.  The smell
throughout the bank is refreshing.

The Depository- Fay Bank~
The smell throughout the building is enriched by the blooming
orchids in the hallway.  The ground is covered in white smooth tiles.
The rocks, in the shape of bricks, must have come from a river where
they were smoothed by time.  A heavy iron door lies to the west which
appears to be guarded.  One can only wonder what lies on the other
side.  A desk sits off to the side of the room where the changer is
positioned for assistance.  The dark cherry wood desk shines and is
not litered with papers.

The stone door is very sturdy, and the stone door can be locked. 
Matching perfectly against the white bricks, the stone door can be
easily looked over.

Cedric's Room of Rivendell "to do" Things~
Valley-
, druid elves
, wood elves
, faeries/sprites/brownies
Cave-
, light "sensitive"
, art work on walls
, cave elves
, dwarfs
Air-
, art work "sunrays"
, arials sitting/nesting on cliffs
STAR world
ADD Ideas- cave may be a hidden treasure room?
    Rings, NATURE, and AIR (light objects)
ADD MORE water...
Around the tree----
, bring in nature- the foot prints do not fit
, bring objects into the city part...and redesign around the tree
, fern fronds and such that make a "natural" path
for water- A tranquil river shimmers with cool, clear water.
The forest is light and the path is wide and unpaved.  The road is of fairly good quality where you are: the dirt of its surface highly 
compacted by the traffic to and from the Rivendell markets each day. To the north and south, it recedes into thick woods.  The forest bars your passage to the east.   
unique race--- akilo?
