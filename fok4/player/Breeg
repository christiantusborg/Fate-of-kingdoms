Ques 4
Desc {DA large, male humanoid is here.  He stands around seven feet
tall, and looks to weigh somewhere close to 260 pounds.  Breeg
Rukharrow is a gargoyle, and his light {Wgrey{D skin appears to be
made of living limestone.  Breeg's chest is broad and well-muscled. 
Iron-corded thews make up his mighty limbs.  He is totally bald, and
wears no facial hair.  His eyes are a smouldering {Bazure{D color
that seem to burn with their own inner fire.  Although Breeg is
powerfully built, he is not bulky or clumsy.  Rather, he moves with a
lithe, springing grace that is reminiscent of a panther poised to
strike.  {x

Back Why should these curses be laid upon me?
 
 
For as long as I can remember, I have been able to speak with
the stones.  All gargoyles share an innate connection with the
bones of the world, yet some of us are born with an even closer
link.  By a simple touch, the silence of the rocks opens up to me.
Their secret language is mine to know.
 
Now, however, they are growing ever more silent as the months progress.
When I try to make contact with the mountains, they refuse to yield
their primal whispers.  I find that I can still speak with the stones
of the cities fairly well, for they have been "cut" from the world and
"civilized" after a fashion.  Their memories are very long.  But it is
to the rocks of Thera that my concerns turn to.
 
What does this portend?  Is there some great upheaval coming, as the
man I have been speaking to (whom I shall call "The Elf") says?  
The Elf speaks of a great disaster approaching Thera.  Personally, I take
his words with a grain of salt.  I know him to be of noble intent, and
my finely-honed bullshit detector hasn't alerted me.  Yet, who among the
ages hasn't spoken of the forthcoming end of days?  We of the gargoi race
know especially of this.  Our libraries and records date back far, and our
ability to stonespeak often gives us unique insight into history.  It 
seems to be that all peoples at all times expect the world to end within
their lives.  
 
Is it meant for us, then, to know?  Will the end come as a prophecied
series of distinct events, or as a sudden flash?  And why should it be I,
Breeg Ruckharrow, who must weather these times?  I am a simple warrior born,
bred for the purpose of metal meeting meat.  I wonder, then, what grander
design the universe has for including me in this passion play.  Derkec,
give me the strength to face the coming challenges.  You lead our actions
and morality by way of your example and martyrdom.  Give me, give us all,
the power to stand face-front in the coming superstorm.
 
Until then, I remain,
                             --Breeg Ruckharrow
