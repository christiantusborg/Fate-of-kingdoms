Inside the maze.~
You are in the Enchanted Maze.  The walls here are all made of
brick.  It is dark, cold, and damp here.  This dungeon is tricky
because all of the caverns look so similar.  You have had to stop
several times to get your wits about you.  You wish that you were at
home in your nice warm bed, and that is rare.  Usually you are game
for any adventure but this maze has a way of wearing the strong down.

Inside the maze.~
You are in the Enchanted Maze.  The walls are made of brick.  The
floor and ceiling of this dungeon are also made of brick.  It is cold
and damp here.  The floor is covered with a thin layer of dust and
when you walk the dust rises in the air making you sneeze.  It is
dark here and you can hear an echoing moan coming from somewhere deep
within these caverns.  You have found yourself having problems
remembering where you came from and where you are going.  You decide
that it is some strange spell radiating from the magical bricks that
has made you forget.  There is a grill on the floor here.  You can go
south or west.

The end of the maze.~
You enter a strange looking room.  The walls are all made of
glowing brick and the only real exit is to the west.  There is a
small opening in the floor here and it looks like a puddle of water. 
Upon further investigation you discover that the puddle is somewhat
like a window.  You see a path in the strange puddle of water.  The
path is surrounded by trees and looks to be a place somewhere in the
Enchanted Valley itself.  The only visible exit is through the door
to the west.  The puddle looks inviting.

You enter a small room.  There is a ladder leading up along the
north wall.  There is a pile of bones here.  It looks as though some
horrid creature has been living here.  You wonder what kind of a sick
animal would actually live in a place like this.  The walls are all
made of brick.  You can only leave the way you came in.

The maze-keepers lair.~
You are in a strange looking room with exits leading off to the
north south and east.  It is strange looking because the walls here,
unlike the rest of the maze, are glowing.  To the west is the door
you came in.  You have a strange feeling that you are close to
finding your way out of the maze.  This dwelling is obviously the
home of some creature.  The walls, floors, and ceilings are all made
of brick, but have been kept clean.  There is no dust on the ground
here like there has been throughout the maze.  You can go north south
or east from here.  There is a door to the west.

The maze-keepers lair.~
You are in a strange looking room.  The room is strange looking
because the walls here , which are made of brick, are glowing with a
magical spell of some sort.  This room has been kept clean and the
brick floor does not have a thick layer of dust like the rest of the
maze.  The glowing aura given off by the walls is magically confusing
you and you wonder if you could even cast a spell here if you tried. 
You can only go south from here.

The maze-keepers lair.~
You are in a strange looking room.  This room makes you feel
magically vulnerable, like you could not cast a spell here if your
life depended on it.  This is an uncomfortable feeling and you really
feel like you should go back to the entrance room before you faint. 
The magical protection of the maze keepers lair is over powering and
leaves you feeling somewhat claustrophobic.

The maze-keepers lair.~
You are in a strange looking room.  Although the walls, ceiling,
and floor are made of brick like the other corridors in the maze,
these walls look a bit different.  The walls here are glowing with
some kind of strange spell.  The closer you get to the walls the more
you feel magically drained.  You know you could not cast a spell if
your life depended on it.  You figure that this strange feeling you
have is caused by the glowing brick that surrounds you.

A hideout in the maze.~
You enter a small room.  The walls are all made of solid brick. 
There is a ladder leading up through a trapdoor in the roof.  There
is a ratty cot in the room and you gather that this would be a good
place to come and rest.  If you close the door, you think, none of
those horrible creatures could get you.  You stretch comfortably and
look at the ratty cot.

A drainage canal in the maze.~
You climb down into a room designed to allow water to seep into. 
The maze floods since there is no where for the water to go to get
out.  This drainage canal prevents the maze from being under water. 
The water comes in through the grill above you and seeps into the
ground.  The walls are made of brick and there is a small ladder
leading up from here.

Inside the Castle.~
You are standing at the entrance to the Enchanted Castle.  There
is a long, wooden floored hallway with a path of red carpeting
stretched out before you to the north.  The walls of the castle are
constructed of brick, but you notice something strange about these
bricks.  That is that they are glowing and you can almost feel the
magic radiating from them.  The enchanted castle is said to be a
place to come when you need to be reminded of the mystical side of an
otherwise logical world.  You are beginning to see why this is.  You
can go north from here down the long hallway.

to the Enchanted Castle.  The brick walls are glowing with a magical
aura.  The walls have been decorated with pictures.  These pictures
depict different races using magic in their nown distinct ways.  You
see a picture of a mage casting a powerful spell on a large dragon
taming it with his magic.  You see another picture of a thief casting
a spell upon himself for greater agility.  The castle is based on all
in the world that is magical.  You can follow the long hallway north
or south from here.

west from here is carpeted.  The carpeting is half black and half
white.  Looking north around the stairway the hallway that you are
walking on now continues.  The red path follows the stairway up and
the wooden floor becomes carpeted to the north.  The carpeting toward
the north, like that of the hallway leading east and west is half
black and half white.  There is also a small stairway leading down
from here.  You can travel in any of the cardinal directions, up or
down.

carpeting is half white and half black.  The black side of the
carpeting is on the east half of the hallway.  You notice that the
pictures on the wall have to changed.  The west wall is decorated
with pictures of thieves doing good deeds.  It appears that the
thieves are sharing with the poor in these pictures.  The east wall
is decorated with pictures of thieves also, although, these pictures
depict the dark side of thieving.  There is a picture that shows a
thief ready to backstab an unsuspecting by standard in cold blood. 
You can go north or south from here.

You are walking down a large hallway in the Enchanted Castle.  The
floor is covered with carpeting that is half black and half white. 
There are only pictures of thieves on the walls here where south of
the stairway you noticed pictures of clerics and mages.  You run you
hand across the wall as you walk and notice a strange sensation in
your fingertips.  Out of curiosity you put your whole hand on the
wall.  You are overcome with the sense of evil.  You realize that you
are touching the wall on the black side of the hallway.  You try to
touch the wall on the opposite side of the hallway and you notice the
overwhelming feeling of goodness.  You decide that this whole castle
is magical and continue on your way.  You can go north or south down
the large hallway.

black and half white and has a large yin-yang sign in the middle. 
You can go south down the long hallway or through one of the three
doors.

on the white side of the hallway are casting spells to benefit
others.  You see on of these pictures where a mage is casting
protection spell upon a weak man.  The south wall is decorated with
mages casting aimless spells of evil.  You see a picture of a mage

You are walking down a long carpeted hallway.  You have decided
that this is the mages section of the castle by the pictures that you
have seen on the walls.  From what you can tell whoever designed the
castle has split the classification of a mage by the purpose in which
he uses his magic.  The black carpeting and evil pictures on the
south side of the hallway represent the evil devious mages where the
pleasant north side of the hallway represents the good mages.  You
can continue down this hallway east or west.

moat between you and the castle wall.  The vegetation here is
flourishing and looks even greener than you remember the rest of the

notice a small yin-yang symbol printed on one of the bricks.  You can
continue on the path to the west or go to the drawbridge to the east.

wall parallels this path and in this area the wall has been painted

wilted.  This seems odd that the vegetation is withered here and
flourishes every else in the Enchanted valley.  You can go east to

You are walking down a long hallway in the Enchanted Castle.  The
floor is carpeted.  The carpet is half white and half black.  You
notice that the walls here have been decorated with pictures of
clerics.  The clerics on the north wall are casting healing spells on
sick children.  The clerics on the south wall are draining the life
out of sick and innocent poverty stricken people.  You shudder in the
evilness of the pictures on the south side of the hallway.  You can

what you have seen in the pictures on the wall you decide that this

clerics.  Evil doing clerics on the south side and good deed doers on
the north.  You can go east or west down this black and white

underbrush of this thick forest.  There are tree branches creating
walls and a ceiling here.  You can smell the moisture of the forest
around you and you can tell that something lives here.  There is hair
on the dirt floor and the dirt has been cleared recently of leaves
and other debris.

path appears to be flourishing even though the surrounding forest is
not that thick.  The greenery around the path gives you a slight
tingling up your spine, the feeling you have when there is something
magical in the air.  You can't help but to be curious what adventures
lie to the north.  You have heard rumors of a mystical place called
the realms of enchantment and you find yourself hoping that this is
the famed magical path that will lead you to your destiny.  The path
winds through the thick vegetation to the north.  There is a sign
here.  There is a clearing in the brush to your west.

You are walking on a small path through a dense patch of forest. 
The trees in this part of the woods are much more green and large
than those of the surrounding forest.  The magical aura in the air is
strong here.  You hear a small bubbling sound coming from one of the
moss ridden rocks on the side of the path.  The overwhelming feeling
of sanctuary has entered your mind through the hypnotizing sound of
the bubbling water and the soft chirping of various birds that have
made their home in this thick part of the forest.  You are overcome
by the beauty of the woods around you.  The path leads north into the
misty, thick forest.  The path also leads south to the main road.

A mystic path.~
You are walking on a small path through a dense mystical forest. 
There are mossy rocks on either side of the path.  The rocks are
moist, which is odd, considering that the rest of this forest is semi
- arid.  The path winds down a rocky slope.  The air is thick with
moisture and you can see by looking down the path toward the north
that if you decide to head that way you will be encountering some
fog.  The ground is a bit slippery from the moisture in this area,
and you wonder why the forest is thriving and the ground is moist
just on this path.  You can go down into the valley that lies to the
north, or back south to the main road from here.

The enchanted valley.~
You are walking on a small path in a valley.  The magic in the air
is overwhelming.  Magic, when it is in the air, is better described
as an emotion in itself.  It makes you have the same feeling that you
do right after you cast a powerful spell.  The feeling that radiates
from your hands which just unleashed magic.  In the Valley of
Enchantment your whole body feels that way and it is a wonderful
feeling.  Like that of climbing the highest mountain.  No wonder why
you have heard so many good things about this place.  It is almost
like a drug.  You are surround by a thin fog that hangs in the big,
green leaves of the trees.  The valley, which you entered from the
south, stretches out in every direction.  The trees that were so
thick and beautiful on the path to the south dominate the whole
valley floor now.  You can go north or south from here.  
There is a big moss ridden rock to the side of the path.
There is a large tree here.

You enter the large tree trunk. It has been hollowed out nicely. It must
have took a lot of work to make this dwelling. The walls are still very
thick and it makes the room very quiet. It smells of fresh wood, which you
find normal, because the tree you are inside is still alive. Everywhere
you go in this valley seems you seem to be bombarded by magical air. This
tree was obviously made as some type of dwelling for something to live in
and you wonder what it could be.

Realms of Enchantment.  From what you have heard (from the people who
actually made it out of this place) magic is everywhere.  Monsters
that are said to only exist in fiction exist here.  You hear a
distant howl that makes your bones shiver.  Maybe , you think, you
should go back to the top of the valley where everything is calm and
beautiful.  The deeper you go into the valley the more concerned you

untraveled path.  You here rustling in the leaves around you.  The

being watched and that this path heads somewhere you shouldn't be.

The feeling that you are close to something very evil is

perhaps from the humidity.  It is warm and the humidity intensifies
the temperature.  There is not enough sunlight allowed in by the
surrounding trees to let you see clearly and that makes you quite
uncomfortable.  There is a pile of brush to the east and the path

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are walking on a small path in the Enchanted Valley.  The
forest is thick on both sides of the path.  The ground is moist,
making the dirt slippery.  There is a layer of leaves covering the
path you are walking on.  The leaves are not crushed making you think
that you are the first to travel this path for quite some time.  You
can go east or west from here.

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are walking on a small path in the Enchanted Valley.  The path
is not well traveled.  It looks like you are the first one to walk on
the path for quite some time.  There is a strong stale smell in the
air.  The ground is moist and covered with leaves.  You hear no
sounds except for a distant moan coming from the north.  You can go
north or west from here.

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are on a small path in the Enchanted Valley.  The trees are
thick on both sides of this small untraveled path.  There are moss
ridden rocks hidden under thick forest growth in the trees on the
sides of the path.  You hear no birds in this beautiful, thick
forest.  Strange, you think, if I were a bird I would like to live in
a place like this.  Then you begin to think maybe there is some reason
why the birds are not living here.  You can go north or south from
here.

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are on a small path.  The path is surrounded by a thick
forest.  It seems that the forest becomes even thicker to the north. 
There is hill that slopes downward to the north and descends deeper
into the dense valley.  The ground is moist and covered with leaves
making it quite slippery.  You gain solid footing to be sure you
don't slip and hurt yourself.  You can go down or south from here.

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are on a small, rocky, slippery path leading down a slope
deeper into the Enchanted Valley.  There is a brick structure at the
bottom of the hill.  The structure looks as if it was built right
into the side of the hill on the other side of this deep crevice that
you are walking down into.  The path appears to lead right into this
structure.  You can go north or up from here.  To the north you see
the large brick structure.

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are on a small path on a hill.  The hill leads down into a
deep crevice.  There is a brick structure at the bottom.  This brick
structure has been build going into the hill on the other side of
this crevice so you have no idea how big it is.  The ground is wet
and covered with rocks and leaves making it very slippery.  You can
go north or south from here.

Path to the Enchanted Maze~
You are on a small path on a hill sloping into a deep crevice. 
There is a large brick structure down the crevice.  The structure has
been built into the hill opposite of the one you are on now.  The
entrance is just down from you.  It looks intimidating.  You wonder
if maybe you should turn around and run home with your tail between
your legs.  You can go south or down from here.

Inside the maze.~
You are in the Enchanted Maze. You are surrounded by magical brick. You
look close at the walls here and you notice a crimson liquid oozing from
in between the cracks in the brick. You touch the liquid and get some on
your finger. You smell it and it smells like blood. You get chills up and
down your spine as you taste this substance and identify it as ,
undoubtably, blood. You can go north, south, or east from here..f

adventurer lost in the maze or if it is a horrible monster that is
going to eat you.  You can go east or west from here.

torch fastened to the wall here making it somewhat light here. 
Looking at your surroundings under the light of the torch you can see
the outline of a trapdoor on the floor.  You hope that it is the way
out of this dreadful place.  There is a keyhole near the top corner
of the door that is on the floor.  You can go east or west from here.

You are in the Enchanted Maze.  The walls are made of thick,
solid, magical brick.  You look around and notice that everywhere you
go here looks the same.  You are becoming confused by the similar
surroundings and you are beginning to forget which direction you came
from.  You decide that there is some spell here which is making you
forget and you shake your head rapidly back and forth to shake it off
and get your wits.  You realize that you were just shaking your head
and begin to think that the maze is getting the best of you.  You can
go north or west from here.

some unknow magical force.  The floor is also made of brick.  You are
totally enclosed by the magical, solid, thick brick.  You feel
uncomfortable where you are now and, although you are weary, you feel
it would be very unwise to rest here.  You can go north or south from
here.

was left behind from a wounded adventurer, or some creature that was
bleeding to death trying to find his or it's way out of this maze.

From the stories told of the enchanted maze, which have been passed
down from generation to generation, there is only one way out of this
place.  The story tells of a maze keeper that holds the key to a
secret door that leads out of the maze.  You wonder to yourself why
you ever came here in the first place.

when you walk the dust rises in the air making you sneeze.  It is

within these caverns.  You have found yourself having problems
remembering where you came from and where you are going.  You decide
that it is some strange spell radiating from the magical bricks that
has made you forget.

because all of the caverns look so similar.  You have had to stop
several times to get your wits about you.  You wish that you were at

for any adventure but this maze has a way of wearing the strong down.

You can see some clawed footprints, some small bird like tracks, and
tracks that look like yours going in the opposite direction that you
are traveling now.  You try to see if the tracks are yours by lifting
your boot and looking at the marks.  You fall down.  You begin to
laugh and when gather yourself you decide that there is some kind of
strange magic at work here.  There is a door here with a
