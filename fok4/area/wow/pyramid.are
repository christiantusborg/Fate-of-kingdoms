The Atomic Wasteland~
You come to the eastern end of the Great Desert. There is not much of a 
change in the terrain to the east, except for some withering vegetation 
which at one time thrived in this area. If the stories you heard in town are
true, there is a vast atomic wasteland just east of the Great Desert. This 
wasteland was once the wonderful thriving city of Lankford. The atomic 
aftermath would explain the death of the plant life here, but you wonder
if this is the place that you have heard so much about.

Atomic Wasteland.~
You are walking along a narrow path that leads through debris and
withered vegetation.  You hear nothing except an occasional moan,
which, if your assumption is right about this being the sight of the
dropping of the atomic bomb, could be coming from one of the devils
summoned here to protect the secrets of Lankford.  You have heard
tales of the city which was leveled by the bomb, and along with those
stories you were told that there were devils summoned here by the
protectors of the old mages magic.  Lankford once was the home of
many people and among those people were the seekers of knowledge. 
These 'seekers' were studying the ways of magic in hopes of someday
finding the ways of the Naturalists.  There is a pile of debris to
the north.

Atomic Wasteland.~
The path continues to lead you through what looks like was once an
arid forest.  None of the trees hold leaves or needles, and even the
weeds that were once green have taken a dead, yellow, lifeless color.
This must be the sight of the atomic fallout, you think, as you take
a deep breath of tainted air.  You almost choke knowing that you are
breathing radiation, but thoughts of the ruined city of Lankford run
through your mind and instead of wanting to leave this place you want
to uncover the hidden history of the once great city.  The path takes
a turn to the north leading around a huge pile of dead brush.

Atomic Wasteland.~
The narrow path through this debris ridden wasteland leads you
around a pile of brush and heads south and east from here.  There are
signs of radiation decay all around you and you begin to notice that
the dead vegetation is almost melting into piles of waste.  You can
almost make out pieces of concrete under your feet, but you can't
tell if it is just course sand or actually an old road.  In the
distance to the east you can see a pile of rock and debris that looks
to neat to be just a rock pile.  Perhaps it was once the city walls
of Lankford.

The narrow path you are traveling on continues to lead you through
this field of dead forest.  You take a breath and notice that the air
you are breathing is tainted with radiation.  There is a haze
emanating from the rotting vegetation that you didn't notice before. 
It is creating an almost fogy atmosphere all around you.  The pile of
rock and debris to the east looks like a demolished city gate.

You stand before a pile of rock and debris.  Looking to the north
and south you can see that the rock continues and come to the
conclusion that this was once the city gates of Lankford.  Looking
east you see leveled buildings, piles of ash, and what looks to be
statues that must have some how withstood the blast that leveled
everything else.  It is quiet here and thinking of all of the people
that died here sends chills up your spine.  The aura of magic in the
air is only matched by that of the radiation that is currently making
your lungs burn with each breath.  The foggy atmosphere is clearing
toward the east.

You are inside what used to be the city walls of Lankford.  There
is wreckage and debris everywhere.  You imagine the holocaust
happening.  One instant life is predictable and lovely and the next
....  Ash and wreckage.  Looking around you can see the layout of the
city over the flattened buildings.  You are walking down what used to
be the main road through the city.  The debris ridden main road leads
east.  There is a road leading north and south that used to follow
the now crushed city walls.

piles of ashes which were once citizens of Lankford, and burned
landscapes are among the things you see as you look around.  The only
sounds you hear are some distant moans coming from creatures that
roam this nothingness that was once a thriving city.  To the east you
see a statue that appears to have been spared by this utter
destruction.  The main road continues east and west from where you

heard rumors about , but this is serious !  There are no buildings
left standing, no stone left unturned.  You hear the occasional moan
of some weary creatures, but other from that it is quiet here.  You
are lost in thought of the holocaust that happened here.  The road
leads around the broken city walls to the north and back to the
demolished city gates to the south.

that were once shops, broken concrete which was once a road that
people walked, and dried up rotting messes that were once happy
peoples yards all run through your mind as you walk through the
leveled city.  There appears to be some standing structures in the
city square to the east.  How could anything withstand the power that
leveled this city ....  The main road continues to the east and west.

The city square was once where the citizens and visitors of
Lankford went to pay tribute to the Naturalist that they worshiped. 
There were statues built in memory of the Naturalists that at one
time walked these realms.  Adventurers converged in the city square
to talk of battles fought and won.  They also discussed here quests
to be taken and riches to be won.  The statues that were built in
this city square were somehow sparred by the atomic devastation.  The
main road continues through the city square to the east and toward

You are in the center of what used to be the thriving city of

directions you can see statues.  This is quite bizarre considering
that everything here has been leveled by the atomic bomb.  There is a
well in the middle of the city square, and it also looks to have been
sparred by the destruction.  This well once held the wishes of many
people.  The people would come here, throw a coin into the well and
hope that the wish they made came true.  You wonder who's wish it was
for this beautiful place to be wiped out.  Exits lead off in all
cardinal directions from here.  The ruined gates are west, the main
road continues east and west.  Aromain Blv.  Leads north and south
from here.  There is a wooden door beside the well, maby it is a

The goal of the people of Lankford was to someday find the ways of
the Naturalists and the magic that they used.  There were statues
constructed of those that they worshiped and those statues were
somehow sparred by the holocaust.  As a matter of fact the entire
city square seems to have been left untouched by the affects of the
atomic bomb.  The main road leads east and west from here.  The

You are traveling on Eastern Wall Road.  The road has been left in

near the road so the debris and trash that they became stayed clear
of the path that you now travel.  The road continues north and south.

The story that you heard also said that the structure was built at

Eastern wall road.~
You are walking along the eastern wall.  This wall surrounds the
whole city providing access to and from only at the gates to the
west.  There are ruined buildings to the west, and all you can see to
the east is the remains of the old wall.  It is still high enough to
block your view over it.  The air is thick with radiation.  The road
continues north and south.

Lankford city square.~
The city square appears to be untouched by the devastation that
wiped out the rest of the city surrounding you.  You wonder if it had
something to do with the statues that surround the city square. 
These statues were left untouched also.  The statues are chiseled in
memory of Naturalists which the citizens of Lankford worshiped.  The
citizens of Lankford sought to find the ways of the Naturalists. 
Exits from here are north and south.  Aeromain Blv.  Continues north
and the center of the city is to the south.

Lankford city square.~
You are in the city square of what used to be the wonderful city
of Lankford.  The square is the only thing within miles that has not
been completely demolished.  The center of the city was somehow
sparred by the atomic wrath and the statues which stand here were
left untouched also.  The statues which stand here, in the center of
the city, were left seemingly untouched.  They all look exactly the
way they did when they were chiseled so long ago.  Aromain Blv.

by the atomic bomb that was dropped here.  That part of the city that
has been left in excellent condition and preserved for all these
years is the city square.  The air is thick with radiation and burns
your lungs as you breathe.  It is quiet.  The road you are on

them to be immortal.  They prayed to them as if they were gods.  The
people usually held ceremonies in the city square which is directly
north of here.  You see some structures to the north that are still

atomic technology before it was unleashed upon them and possibly
built this structure to provide a place for the elite citizens to
hide in case the bomb was dropped.  You wonder if the stories are
true.  You also wonder if they are true what horrors the shelter will
hold after all these years.  The road continues east and west.  You

magic that they did not want to release on the realms beyond the city
walls.  The road continues west and east.  There is a building that

This was for protection.  The wall provided the city with sanctuary
from the outside world and ensured the secrets that were kept here
remained secrets.  The wall didn't do much good protecting the city
from an atomic bomb though.  This technology was unknown by the
citizens, although, at home you have heard rumors of a bomb shelter.

of the wall that are meer piles of trash, but this corner of the wall

wishes.  Looking up you see that the well is not even really a well
at all.  It is a mechanical fountain that pumps water into a
container to resemble a well.  You wonder if the citizens knew of
this, or if they were fooled into believing that it was really a
well.  The only exit is west.

gone making it easier to breathe.  There are strange runes carved
into the wall.  The citizens who built this structure carved pictures
of the naturalists and their magic words on the walls here in hopes
that it would help protect this structure from any bomb.  To build a
bomb shelter shows that the citizens had, either the power to
for-tell the future, or a source that warned them that the city was

that they could not go back into the city or they would be radiated
and burned, or turned into some horrible beast of a monster.  The
Lankfordians kind of started to make a new city under ground.  You
can go down farther into this underworld or up toward the original

elite citizens of Lankford were granted access to the bomb shelter at
the time of the dropping of the bomb.  They were living together in
the room just south of here and they begin to dig out new rooms for
more privacy and room.  This is one room that the citizens made. 
They also built another level to this 'underworld' which is down the
stairs just to the south of here.  The trapdoor is to the south.

had on their hands living underground.  You can go back up the stairs

A cold room.~
You are in a room that was hidden behind a plank.  It is freezing
in here You are in a room that was hidden behind a plank.  It is
freezing in here fluid.  You wonder what this place is and why it was
hidden.  The breeze that you felt earlier is gone.  But your fingers
are beginning to numb due to the extreme cold temperatures.  You can
only go back through the plank to the west.

A small cold corridor~
The corridor is small and dirty.  It is very cold here.  So cold,
in fact, that it makes you wonder what the heck is going on.  You are
practically in the middle of a desert and even though you are far
underground it should not be this cold.  There is a slight breeze
coming from the east, which is also quite weird considering that you
are underground and there is no ventilation that you could imagine
without radiation seeping in from the outside.  You shiver while you
think.  You can go east or west from here.

A cold room.~
You are standing in a small room.  The walls are all made of dirt
just like the rest of this 'underworld'.  It is unbarably cold in
here.  You wonder if the Lankfordians have made some kind of climate
control device to lower the temperatures.  Maybe the device went out
of control.  Why would anyone want it so cold?  The air is still here
and the breeze that you could feel in the corridor is not noticeable
in this room.  You can only go south from here.

A small cold corridor.~
You are impressed by how big this once small bomb shelter has
become.  You wonder how long it took to dig this place out.  Where
the heck did they put all the dirt, you wonder, and then stop
thinking about it because you are so cold.  Your hands are beginning
to get numb and you wish you were in the sunlight again.  You can
feel a slight breeze coming from the east and you think it is strange
because you are so far underground.  You can go east or west from
here.

The top of a cold stairway.~
You are at the top of a stairway.  It is a narrow stairway and you
feel cold air coming from the passage.  The room you are in is also
cold.  You wonder why it is so cold in this underground place.  Your
hands are numb and you are shivering.  You long for the sunlight that
you once knew.  What a horrible existence to live underground in the
freezing cold.  You can go down the stairs, or you can go west from
here.

You are at the bottom of the stairway in a small, cold, dark
corridor.  You can hear some noises coming from the corridor to the
north.  You are very deep underground now and you are beginning to
think that you will freeze by staying here.  You bundle up your armor
and stick your fingers under your body-suit to keep them warm.  This
place is amazing for just being once a simple bomb shelter.  You
wonder what secrets the Lankfordians are hiding here.  You can go up
the stairs or north from here.

deepest underground you ever want to be and you are starting to want
to see the sun in a bad way.  The freezing climate in this place must
make it unbarable to live, although, you are beginning to get used to
it and you assume that the mean people that live here have adapted to
the cold.  You can go north or south from here.

You are in a huge room far underground.  The Lankfordians built
this huge room in their underworld and consider it the main part of
their new 'city'.  The Lankfordians have discovered a way to freeze
the most important people to have them wake at a better time.  That
is what they spend all of their time underground doing.  This room
was set up as the main part of the 'underworld' and everything that
has any importance to the Lankfordians is carried on in this room.

can see various signs that the Lankfordians have been tinkering with
cryogenics.  They have been freezing the bodies of the elite mages
and clerics in hopes that they can save them until the air above is
clear enough to breathe.  They don't realize that it is safe on the
surface now..  But you're not going to be the one to tell them
because they seem to be mean people !

What would it be like to be frozen solid , you wonder, and then get
chills up and down your spine thinking about it.  This huge room is
the main center of the Lankfordian 'underworld'.  This is where they
have their meals, meetings, and practice cryogenics.  This is also
where they study the ways of the naturalists.

is where all of the important events to this civilization take place.
It is somewhat of a city square...  If you could consider this cold
hell a city.  You feel sorry for the angry people that have to live
here and wonder if they know that it is safe to return to the city
above.  You can go west and north from here.

study the ways of the naturalists.  Despite the destruction of their
city, the Lankfordians where able to save all of their great secrets
and continue their work to find the power that they seek.  You wonder
what it would be like to live in a place that is so cold, with no sun
or fresh air for over thirty years.  Then you remember how much you
love the life that you live.

feeling of evil thinking about what may be down the corridor.  It is
cold here and you wish that you were wearing your winter gear,
although, you didn't think you would need it considering that there
is a desert right above you.  You wonder what it is like to be frozen
like all of those Lankfordians have been and you start to think that
you know what it is like because it is so cold here.  You can go east
down the corridor, south or west from here.

The trials for the mis-doers are held in this room also.  It is cold

inclined Lankfordians.  Your hands are beginning to numb and you long

overwhelming evil from the east and you wonder if you should just
steer clear of that part of the underworld.  The main room of the

Images of horrid underworld beasts enter your mind, and you shudder

the sun, or smelled the air of the world that spreads out above you,
far above you.  You can go east or west from here.

allowing for ice crystals to form on the walls and the floor, making
it quite slippery.  You bundle up a little and remember what it is

You are standing in a room with a stairway leading up.  There are
doors with small barred windows leading in all cardinal directions. 
It looks like you are standing in some kind of a jail.  You assume
that even the elite citizens that were granted access have criminals.
Such an elaborate civilization, you think, to have such a place
underground that even has it's own justice system.  It is not as cold
here as it was on the upper levels of this underground fortress.

You come into a small hidden hut.  Something has made it's house
here under this pile of dead vegetation.  The walls are made of twigs
from dead trees, and the floor is dirt.  It smells of rot in this
messy place.  You wonder what could possibly have enough intelligence
to build a place like this that would LIVE in a place like this. 
There is a hole in the make-shift ceiling of this hut and you can see
the sunlight coming through.  Although the air here is somewhat

broken entrance is to the north.  
There is a cellar door at your feet.
