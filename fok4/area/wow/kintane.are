You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills.  Although they seemed fairly
small from a distance, you now get the feeling that they are closing in on you,
towering over you, overwhelming you...  The small path seems to have a sense of
security because some young trees cover some of the nearby area.  To the south,
the hills have a lighter hue of dark.  To the north, you see a mine shaft.  It
seems probably abandon many years ago.

You barely see some lit torches inside.  The cave seems quiet and deserted.
But the sign of lit torches says otherwise.  There are a few traces of minerals
lying around, but the huge portion of the area is 'rock'.

Interior of cave~
Following the mine tracks, you are cautious of your surroundings.  Much of
the caverns you see are 'rock'.  Walls of rock continues in all directions.
There are various flickers of torch lights around the area.  You suspect there
are still people here.

Interior caverns, following the tracks~
Upon following the mining tracks, you journey into the depths of the mountain
caverns.  The walls here are dug and precisely supported by mining beams.
Fragments of discarded stones and rock are lying all around the area.  You also
caution the area.  There are signs of danger all around you.  There are signs
of dim light scattered around indicating that someone is still inside the
mountain caverns.  There are creatures of the caves, like bats and snakes that
you should be worrying about.

There are discarded rocks and stones every where.  It looks as if this part of
the cavern is being sealed off by someone.  Of course, with the access of the
staircase, one would not try to seal off a portion of the cave while people
were mining.  That would be very hazardous to the mining crew.
