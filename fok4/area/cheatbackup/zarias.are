Before the Gates~
You now stand before the massive gates of Sol Daroth.  They are
carved completely from the finest stones in the land.  You must
strain your eyes just to see the tiniest flaw in this stone work. 
The gates push open smoothly and quietly to reveal the wonders
within.

Just inside the Gates~
Walking through the gates you catch your first glimpse of the
wonderful city of stone.  Everything looks to be made from the finest
rocks around.  The roads are perfectly moulded and the buildings are
as flawless as the gates.  People are walking along the roads and
everything in this town seems to be as good as it gets.  You can
follow this road east or west.

A Dark Passage~
As you continue down the path it gets dark.  You feel along the
walls to try and get a sense of where you are going.  Water drips to
your face as you wander aimlessly down the dark passage.  You try and
walk quietly so you dont disturb whatever could be lurking in the
shadows.

A Dark Tunnel~
Darkness surrounds you as you stumble down a pitch black tunnel. 
You feel for the walls on either side of you, moving on inch by inch.
The surface of the walls isn't nearly as smooth as those of dwarves. 
The air about you smells quite stale, despite the fact that every now
and then you hear the scuffling of feet all about you.  Slowly you
continue to stumble down the tunnel, feeling for another exit.

feel strang in here.  They feel wet, but not like water.  It feels

Inside the Cavern~
You're standing within a huge cavern, deep beneath the castle and
town above.  You stand here on a bit of a hill, looking downward into
the cavern below.  There in the middle stand two towering
stalagmites, made of calcium.  Thousands of years of water dripping
into those exact spots has led to the huge, spike shaped mound within
the cavern.  The cavern is quite large as caverns go.  From here, it
expands to the north and west.

You now stand beside the stalagmite, completely dwarfed by its
size.  Torches line the cavern wall behind you, giving off a dim
light.  Water starts to spatter onto your armor and face as it drips
from the ceiling down onto the stalagmite.

Crossway in the Cavern~
The cavern is all around you.  Their are two stalagmites looking
you in the face.  They are monsterous.  You could go north between
them, south out of the cavern or continue walking around the
stalagmites to the east or west.

Between the Stalagmites~
You now stand between the two stalagmites, with one on either side
of you.  A path has been cut out between them, to make traveling
through the cavern a bit easier.  The path is very wet, since water
drips into it and around it constantly throughout the day.  The
torches flicker as the water threatens to put them out.  The cavern
continues to the north and south.

The Duergar Tunnels~
You now stand deep within the tunnels of this large cave.  The
walls and floor are both covered with intricate ruins and other
ancient languages.  Looking closer, you gather that these seem to be
the markings of duergars.  You hear the hustle and bustle of duergars
all about you.  A racket seems to be coming from every branching
tunnel.  Some are the sounds of weapons clanging together, others
sound like machinery, and yet even some have the scriptures of dark
magic being read within them.
