is wearing a dull green dress.  There are no sleeves to hide her
small shoulders.  The dress stops in the middle of her thighs and the
bottem is cut in a jagged fashion.  She wears no other garments save
for a pair of miniscule grey boots.  They stop just above her ankle
and attached to the back of each boot is a silver spur that seems to
somehow cleam.  Her whole minute figure seems to radiate
peacefulness.

length, with a greasy and oily pelt, horrid in a brown or black
color, and usually covered with a wretched mold they get from living
in the sewers.  Their tiny beedy eyes glare in the gentle
torch-light, searching for things to swipe along the sewer path, or
even from the carrier, oftenly finding something to eat.  A long
pinky fuzzy tail ravels behind them, along with big pink ears and
ratty whiskers on their cruel little face.  This little creature
seems to get off a foul odor, even for living in the sewers - the
rats do not bathe in the cold cruel water, instead trying to be away
from the swift current - such as a cat would.

in the back, partially swirled and kept tight with two chopsticks.

of a beast, a strange light green, with a strange scar over his right
eye.  He seems at least partially muscular and well fit for his
height of 6'5.  The man wears a loose but fine looking silk shirt,
with blue cuffed wide sleeves and a blue vest that contains golden
stripes and patterns of a sakura flower.  His legs are covered with a
pair of blue pants, which were quite uncommon under certainties of
some warriors.  Upon his feet he wears a pair of black worn shoes,
made of a foreign leather which he obtained elsewhere, looking quite
scuffed and buffed, one may wonder where they have traveled.

katana~
{x Here sits the Katana of Metsukumi, one of the finest blades in
the entire world, once made from the mystical murasama that lived up
in the mountains, having traveled the world to learn about all
swords, who became the most wise of all sword-makers.  They once say
that maker was a god of the sword, from this beautiful work of art. 
The blade is a full tang sword with a flawless and smooth shinogi
Zukuri shape to it.  The entire ha of the blade is constructed of
what was once considered a useless rock but eventually smelted to
become a sturdy and valuable metal.  This particular material was
said to be tempered and blessed by the Onikumi, and having the divine
ability to strike down anything in one blow.  Nearly the beautifully
designed fuchi is the engraving of some sort of ancient writing,
still visible and legible.  The tsubi was constructed by yet another
artist and made of an ore of the same metal, giving a dark depiction.
The blade is somewhat dull, yet gives a fine blue shine whenever the
gray blade is in the sunlight.  The Tsuka no ito is carefully wrapped
with the finest material, somewhat soft yet grippy, giving the light
weight blade a perfect sense of balance.

the newer existing kingdoms.  Having located in the South has the
advantages of the great forests and bamboo forests.  Gaining the
advantages of plants and being in tone with nature, taking the bamboo
and animals that they only needed to eat and use for factors of
production.  The Daimyo had been growing older in his late fourties
so he gave his younger brother Khang Zhei the chair of being Daimyo
of their lands.  Daimyo Khang Zhei was in his late thirties, and
containing a massive long black beard and a head of long black hair
to his shulder level which he kep tied back very tightly underneath
his hat.  His armor was light and looking barbaric, he wore a set of
bronze armor breast plate and shoulder pads.  The breast plate was
light and tied around him- wearing a long and loose green robe -
wearing it loose for he had great hakama like armor on his legs.  At
his side he wielded a great spear he carved himself from a precious
metal.  Their sister however was only happy with being an officer
general, which would be the only and highest rank in the entire
District for a woman - Nabanya Khang.  A close family friend was to
both Khang Zhei and Nabanya was Zhuo Mi Ten - a chunky swordsman. 
One of Khang Zhei's most trusted warrior was not a warrior but his
daughter - JinSunWu - who was a great tactician who used sneak
attacks with mass ammounts of people from the Xianghau population. 
Despite her low age of the teens, they still trusted her for many
long and epic battles.  Popular warriors that were oftenly used by
JinSun were warriors like The warrior of the gray halberd - Fei Long
Tsuma.  The warrior who used exotic weapons such as dueling whips was
known for his success and strong apperances however so peaceful monk
warrior Xan Shi Long.  The general Yazama Hotuhaga was the warrior of
the yari, a type of lance which he was known for the ability of
mastering his technique.  His own great friend Ren Nagamado used an
exotic weapon of throwing knives - which he was known to be able to
split a peice of bamboo from one hundred feet away.  These generals
were of great skill , but had a massive army behind them of thousands
in the massive city inside the forests.  One of the largest cities,
and friendliest - who Khang Zhei was at a trading alliance with a
foreign Western kngdom.

{xHistory of the Land  - 
{xAeons ago the land came into Existance, made of many rocks which
formed into mountains from molten rocks called volcanos.  Much water
had erroded them away and made thinner mountains, covered in clouds
and shrouded with mist and mystery.  Much life has prospered from
these events of fresh water, keeping the land fertile fresh and
moist.  Exotic plants such as bamboo prospered and continued to grow
throught the land for centuries.  Only creatures and animals had
survived in the tall grassy plains of the land around the area for
many decades, surviving through all four seasons.  Many new plants
came into existance from the great winds that blow from many
directions, such as one comming from the hurricane or typhoon that is
once said to have drifted close to the area.  With those new
materials such as rice and cherry blossom sakura plants in the place,
the land was prosperious with forests and plains.  Many things were
upon the Northern shallow mountains.  The range was long and far,
stretching nearly miles which took up much land, where people find
great uses for mining and of its metals and resources.  Upon the
mountains were a natural phenomenon which occured called hotsprings,
deep and large springs, started out as natural shallow pools but soon
go under ground to make underground streams and rivers that cutted
and erroded away any dirt with fresh and feverish hot bathwater to
make streams .  Most of the hot springs have dried up in the hot
season, but occasionally replenish such as pools of water, suitible
for any sanitary needs.

{xThe History of Nakagau Part One - {xCenturies ago, lived the
many people of the land who inhabitated the small villages, populated
by the many people.  The three virtual Kingdoms inhabitited these
villages in their massive castles of finewood and great white walls
and stones and tiles.  To the North The was the Nakagau, known for
it's strength and sturdiness with reliability, who resided near the
ocean and to the South of the Mountains.  To the East coast line was
the Tsuyazu, who had great support by the sea and by the great winds
from them.  Finally was the immense Xianghau district who was the
great military force, surrounded near forests and the great
mountains.  The leaders of each area may or may have not been the
greater leader , or the original leader, but each city prospered,
growing every larger and larger.  Yet running out of room for
irrigation for the area and crops for the little room on the rock
that they lived on they made compromises.  There were many problems,
with the problems of foreigners who were ignorant and were unwise
about their decisions and knowledge to their culture.  There were
little ways to keep out, and with the the ronin, who were considered
wave men, who did not show any respect to the leaders of the
communities, basically similar to mercenaries, they worked for
themselves.  Things were heating up and problems were tensing between
the kingdoms of three, which word of war began to shake around the
neighborhood of societies.

monogatari~
{x Once born in the early dawn of Tsuyazu when it was only a mere
shanty town, Faisho Genjao was a pleasing young man.  Raised in a
population of hundreds in a adequet sized city, who's mon(symbol) was
that of a red flag and a golden kanji symbol in the center.  Then
under the population of thousands of people Tsuyazu grew to be an
Eastern province nearest to the water, close to the beach.  Because
of that it gave them many sea-food and sea-related minerals to give
them to work with, however gaining significant gain by transfering
clothes and fish to the other two neighboring cities.  The current
Daimyo Sanjao had raised almost a dozen officers underneath his wing,
giving Faisho a close position to being one.  After cleaning out many
of the -foreign Oni- ( foreign ogres/demons) he gained much'
reputation to a town who did not give much care to outsiders out of
their region.  He gained the fame by beheading The leaders of the
Western group's leader who gave nothing but insolence and pollution
to their town .  Nearly years later - after a great monsoon, wiped
out parts of the town of Tsuyazu, and taking the Daimyo Sanjao's life
unfortunetly.  Many people of many cities were saddened by his death,
and gave his body a fair grave returning.  However after the
ceremony, they had questioned to put up to the next Daimyo - seeming
how the death was quite untimely, and many men were qualified. 
Through popular vote of the beheadings of ronin - the population and
some of the officers aggreed that Faisho should take position,
despite his age of 30.  The Faisho Genjao traditionally had a head of
long brownish red hair, which was held with his favorite bandana
around his forehead with the mon of his city.  Also he wore large
bands around his forearms as guards, and a fine tight tuni with many
wraps of types of flat chains .  Those chains were a golden and red,
giving him fine protection and the design, along with his matching
red hakama pants outside of his white pants underneath and a set of
heavy slippers.  Ontop of that calmed hair he wore a turban like
crown, which formerly belong to the Daimyo, which he claimed.  Faisho
Genjao carried a massive sabre, that of a Nodatchi which he recieved
near the time of the other weapons of the Daimyo's.  This new daimyo
was still young compaired to some - however had the reliance of the
Tsuyazu behind him despite his arrogance and hotheaded-ness.  Despite
his gain of power he still showed much respect to his formerly
superiors, such Usegai Kamia - His old command unit leader - General
Red Horn - who wore a helmet with a massive set of red horns on the
sides from that of a great beast once said he slayed with his bear
hands.  His own friend Zunao Masaba, a barbarian of a man who wielded
a massive inverted sickle.  One of the newest recruits but still
formitable warrior - Men Long reaching officer at age of 23 after his
father.  He later became friends with Kajiwara Tsunozenda - the
tactician of the Tsuyazu - who was known of throwing all out attacks
and defensives.  Another of his personal officers that served him
well was Takeshi Naogara, who was the officer - that was famous for
his archery abilities.  However his most respect to was to Manaki
Tanaka - an old personal friend of the daimyo Sanjao's.  However if
he showed his respect only to Sanjao - he was one of the greatest
fighters in all the lands who wielded a spear , once said blessed by
his wife.  With the feared warrior, Manaka ( as called ) No kingdom
dare bother with saying a single bad word about the Tsuyazu.

{x The Daimyo Shanichi Mojimoto came from the long line of daimyos
to run Nakagau, the Northern city that was ran by the mountains. 
Nakagau was a proud city, average in size and area, with a fitting
spot to the south of the great mountains and nar the fine waters. 
The food consisted of a lot of sea-food, animals around their town,
and plants that grew in and around their mountain range.  One of
their most important resource was their great mountains, The Shituku
mountain range, as they called it.  The Mountain was overflowing with
minerals and resources which aided them in making weapons from their
iron or better ores that came from the center of the mountain, deep
inside with such the strongest metals inside the core.  Nakagau had a
great relationship for trade with other countries, important certain
clothes, and transported many ores and metals in return for clothes,
foods, and materials.  The Daimyo Shanichi used a legendary blade
from a core given by the gods as proclaimed and used by the best
weaponsmith in the entire contenent.  He was a thin man, who wore a
thin but fine mustache and a bearded goatee.  Shanichi was indeed a
strong and fine willed man, in his mid thirties.  Wearing the great
armor he was one of the finest warriors, however only fought when the
opportunity came.  His fine social friend and right hand man, was the
man Nakashito Matsuhido.  He also wore his fine thin sword, he gained
also from the finest smith in Nakagau.  His trademark was his thick
arm-armor which on either side contained a massive cloth mon of
Nakagau' showing his Patriotic side.  Shanichi Mojimoto had collected
an array of impressive generals from far travels that he once often
had done to gather his kingdom.  Now an average sized city with the
protection of generals that were native and foreign.  Lu Taijen - the
warrior of the foreign Kwan Do blades - who was one of Mojimoto's
most loyalest servants of the generals.  His great army heavy calvery
was the man of the hellkytes- Hiden Oyanomitu who wore red armor and
cloaks, known for his great leap while escaping his enemies.  A well
known native was Gi mantumasa who was a man known for wielding set of
silver claws.  A warrior who was feared to be seen was Kagetsu
Mayoshiro, who was feared for his exotic weapon that people sought in
confusion, the basic sword whip, chain link sword.  Tan Yorimoto, was
a general underneath Naka's orders, but still obeyed Shanichi.  Their
tactician was Usikon Paganasa, who was quite the old man, but who was
quite resourceful with small ammounts of soldiers to leading into
battles.  One warrior however that followed orders of Shanichi made
him slightly unpopular with people for having a foreign "Knight" of
Shanichi.  The foreign ninjitsu tribe, the man they called Rantatsu. 
Not much was known about this man, nor not many knew about his
presence, but he was the sword wielding assassin that kept to himself
in the shadows, only ordered by shanichi if he could.  More of an
allie than an officer - many thought that the man might bring chaos
to the neutral city of Nakagau.  However Daimyo Mojimoto was still a
kind and peaceful man, who had a line of two sons to take after him
if he had an untimely death.

The Suite of the Lucky Neko~
{x Such a residential honeymooner!  The room seems to be made of
two rooms, with a main room and a bedroom.  The floor is made of a
wood with redden silk rugs, the room looking mighty plush and soft. 
The main room is very spacious, with a small cabinet to the Eastern
wall, with a few windows with large shades able to be closed.  A
closet to the east able to hold whatever you tend to put in there,
although not many could afford to spend too many nights in the sweet.
A large queen sized bed sits in the corner of the large room.  With
wooden bed posts and soft cushions and comfy blankets.

below.  The floor sure is soft, and comfy, the room only seems to be
a one in a half sized room though.  With three beds that raise a food
of the ground, made close to each other on the wooden frames.  The
room is lit with it's lights, and above is a lamp to illuminate the
room very brightly.

grass and a metal path.  The Tower itself is a light gray on the
outside, with the wooden roof of another.  A large iron gate to the
West cuts out any annoying unwanted souls to this sacred shrine of
power.  Aside from the 5 foot tall white materialistic fence is a
small brown roofish form upon it, blocking any imediat exit to the
West.  The Shrine is just down from here, a small metal pat of gravel
and metal chunks lead on to the Pagoda.

can see nearly the entire Eastern and Northern Section of town, and
nearly outside the awll.  The Grass here is short, usually trimmed
and kept everyday, along with large flowerbushes and a fine random
rock path, imbeded into the ground.

The Bottom of the Shrine of Morinaga~
{x Here is the bottem of the shrine, with a thick stone floor
almost made of what seems to be a concrete.  The entire shrine is
rather dark with a single square opening to the south, where a dirt
path remains, to lead back to the Nanami street.  The awlls are made
of stone, and covered with a decorative material, with many little
religious items scattered about.

The top of the Shrine of Morinaga~
{x Here is the shrine to the sacred Morinaga.  The tower shrine is
made of a gray stone, adobe and wood.  Spiraling stairs twist upwards
into a somewhat cylander shape that tappers upwards to the wooden
roof.  The floors are constructed of a reinforced wood and thin
slates of stone, and the walls are also made of a light and pastel
color.  Windows all along the tower light up the room nicely. 
Leading down the stone firm steps is the first floor, where most
people pray and pay their respects.

stairs.  The room is lined with a few windows and candles along 3
small pillows that are able to be sat on in the small pagota shrine.

giving off a powerful feeling.  With large bricks for the floor, and
walls and of course a arched ceiling painted with the finest artists,
showing civilization must have been down here at one point.  Those
red and blue torches travel down to the North, and light up the room.
Massive pillars stand stories high, keeping this sanctity up, and
having kept it up for centuries.  That massive door stands to the
North again, of a strange metallic material with golden rims and
edges.  Upon the center of that door is a gemstone of a great
aquamarine, and yet another slot that resembles to be that for some
sort of weapon.

The Entrance to the Sanctuary of the White Wurm~
{x Beyond those two massive doors lays a paradise, of a
breathtaking scene, with a grassy ground, the walls look natural,
like stone.  Yet a fresh breeze and clean air is felt comming from
somewhere in this small sanctuary.  A Small pond rests here, near a
small stream and what seems to be that waterfall from each side of
the sanctuary, one stream hot and one stream cold, meeting at a pond
to make refreshing pond of clean and cool crisp steep pond.  Each
flow of water comes from a waterful on each side, creating a small
shroud of mist.  Large trees and comfortable rocks sit around the
area, with a small man made path leading to the North.  The sky is
very blue, although strange for being underground, the light
seemingly comes from the sky, which is just a detailed drawing, or is
it?

The Sanctuary of the White Wurm~
{x Comming from the small manmade path comes a massive brick laid
pattern of a enourmas circle in the shape of a celestial design of
ancient symbols.  The scene is of a small forest, with an ancient
tree and a massive rock where it seems like a nice place to rest. 
The endless rock ends here, where a beautiful scene of a massive
ocean is seen, where many great islands of tropics and mountains are.
Thousands of tiny caves and holes within that mountain spew with
water to join with that realm of water, giving a fresh cool breeze to
the sanctuary.  In that sky are the pictures of clouds, that change
color from time to time, from orange, white, gray, and pink, strange
how they magically strange.  This ancient restling place is not only
a sanctuary in the sewers, but a entrance to another realm, guarded
by the great dragon.

by common visitors of the ronin and bounty hunters.  Otherwise the
office would be rather small and empty, just a large scroll that is
constantly being upheld of a long scroll containing black ink ,
rolling down of constant names and verticle symbols that list off
bounties.  The only furniture is that single desk to write on that
contains a sword, scroll, and a small jar of ink to keep the

safe within this office, along with many other relevant scrolls and

in the inn, and what a bathroom it is.  It has a small wooden pot,
used for the toilet, which is cleaned daily.  And in one side of the
room ontop of the fine warm tile floor is a hot tub and a bath.  It's
bubbly and filled with a very hot water, ready for use.  Warm and
fuzzy pink towels made of a fine cotton lay on the side, waiting to
be used.  Two silky Yukata's for bathing after rest beside them.  The
floor is lined with a nice matted bamboo mat, with light shining down
on them from the small windows.

collapse in boulders, obviously the weight of the tunnels was too
much around this sector.  A few of the torches are still lit, and the
strong current keeps a few of the rocks, and still flowing, however
too strong to swim through.  The only choice to get by is possibly to
go around the cluttered tunnels.

it leads from the North and South.  The Walls are made from a very
dark looking gray-blue brick, and so are the floors and ceiling, laid
with a brown sand inbetween the cracks on the ground.

The Chamber of Mojimoto~
{x These are the great concealed halls of the legends, where only
few have seen.  The walls are glassy and seem to be made of the
Jasper color which seem to have once been rich in the mountain
centuries ago.  The floor seems also glassy and smooth, with the
finest silk rug that runs down the center of the massive halls.  The
room is a usually very silent and untouched place for hundreds of
suns and moons.  Being so far away from the surface, the entire
chamber is very cold, except for the slight lighting of the glass
torches, magically burning with white fire.

seems like a small cubical of stone gray and blue bricks, with two
torches on either side, with a rusted metal iron latter leads.  From

Constructed of wood and through a large hole in the ground, and now
you stand at an upraise of brown chisled stone.  The large ceiling is
curled with an arc, and periodically torches around to keep the place
lit up.  To the East of this dark and dank smell sewerway is a almost
fresh, yet grayish murky water.

of stone spiral staircase, once used by the Daisho to escape from
danger.  It was made of a cylander pattern of layed bricks, with the
same stone walls.  There doesn't seem to be any other exit other than
up.

many many paths, by the path.  The Paths are an upraised brownish tan
stone path, with a sudden drop off of a very deep ditch for the water
to flow down a water level a foot from the corner edge of the path. 
The walls and arced curved ceiling is made of a smooth and slightly
moldy stone brick.

bricks are a light tan like brown, and lined with torches to light up
the path.  A path lies on either side, and seperated with a large
section of very deep murkey water, of 5 feet across.  So the water
space isn't that big, but then plumbing is not well known throughout
Thera.

the ditch, where that murker water is.  Inthe middle of a water is a
rusty chain that leads right down into the water, and a pulley to the
ceiling to a stone brick in the middle, able to be lifted and alter
the course of the water.  A table sits here in the stone walls,
ceiling and floors, a very fine cave it was.  The coldness of the
stone raises into the air, with the aweful smell of rotting flesh. 
Blood stains and torches line these walls.

The Tunnel in the Sewers~
{x Here is more of the long stretching tunnels, constructed by tan
bricks, which once were natural underground gaves, but paved over in
a tall arced structure.  Along the floor are two sidewalks along the
walls, and a large stream inebtween the two two sidewalks that seems
very deep, and filled with chilly cool and clean water.

{x The tunnels finally come to a slight curve and a bend in the
sewer system.  The tan bricks smoothly fold over to a ninety degree
angle, along with the splashing water that curves along with it,
heading to it's final destination, wherever it may lead, constantly
flowing in the gray deep path it must follow.

and travels north to what seems to be a large lighted dome room where
the water swirls and prespires.  The tan bricks head all along the
corner, but a door-frame sits to the north, along with cheap wooden
bridges between the streams to allow passage without risking the jump
of the water stream.

here, and more of the water heading south but are blocked off by
bars.  The water has a tiny stream set by a inset slice of bamboo
that allows the water to slide down from whatever is ontop of here. 
Elsewhere there is a large slanted peice of bamboo, that is shaped
like a spiral that keeps rotating and supplies the water above ground
by catching and twisting the water, and powered by what seems to be
by a waterwheel that sits off the side of the gray path.  Upon the
tan walls seems to be a wooden ladder that seems fresh and suitible

grows up the walls, so it is able to climb up or dow, although that

fit a group of people through.  While in the meantime the rest of the

off the main stretch of tan bricks.  A stretch of torches light that
seperate tunnel along as the main,with a split of water that travels
down also.  A tiny wooden bridge archs over the seperate tunnel to
continue a path East to west if along the Southern sidewalk between
the large stream.

The Natural underground Stream~
{x From the North came the brick paths, and half way through the
walls end the tan bricks and widden into a brown rock, unchisled and
unfinished by man, only one may wonder where they lead to.  If one
purposely didn't finish them, or simply forgot about it?  The tunnels
themselves are covered with a tiny peridot and malachite crystals
that line through the walls.  The floor is made of mud and still
continue on with the two foot deep stream cutting through a v crevice
in the slippery floor.

{x The natural tunnels are an exquisit beaty of their own, a
completely naturally formed set of brown tunnels that twist and turn
with the waters.  The floor is made of a few rocks and mainly a
slippery and tricky brown mud, with a thick blue fresh stream flowing
to the East.  The tunnels are a good size, slightly larger than the
man exevated tunnels, yet just as sturdy.  Lined along each walls are
tiny malachite and peridot rocks and crystals that collect light and
distribute it through the natural tunnels.

thick clear blue stream flows through the muddy and slippery flor,
nearly 2 feet deap of a non-steep V shaped floor, cutting along the
path.  The walls are made of a brown thick rock, untouched by man,
and still slightly jagged and slippery and smooth from the moisture,
and placed with peridots and malachites to glimmer a path through the
dark tunnels.

by man, yet still beautiful in either way.  The walls and curved arc
ceiling are made of a thick brown stone, firm and steady, almost as
much as the pillars.  The floor is made of a slippery and wet mud
while a thick stream down the center flows Eastward.  Instead of the
wooden torches are a brilliant peridot and malachite material,
collecting any light and giving a burst of it's own to light up the
natural pathway.

to glint up what light there is in neighboring tunnels to light up

An Underground Lagoon~
{x From the muddy natural and untouched tunnel came from a
widdening path, to a huge beacy like area, with soft sandy wet
gravils, with pure soft thin sands, completely rockless.  Down in the
waters were pure and clean, only a rocky bottem, only a few silvery
fish seen in the deeper end, continueing into the huge caves with
deeper cool fresh waters.  A thin path travels around the massive
cave, to support a walkway.  From the massive ceiling nearly 100 feet
up that touches the surface, has tiny openings which sunlight shines
through along with tiny trips of water from the moisture.

dome overhead giving the veiw of sunlight and fresh air.  The water
is crystal clear and sparkling from the sunlight giving from the
sunbeams that loft in through the ceiling.  The walls of the cove are
made of a thick untouched rock, and a primitive tunnel to the West
along with a sandy beach.  In the center of the massive tunnel is a
large stone, with a warm beam of sunlight, glinting on the pedistle
of the huge underground gaves.  A small whirlpool is at the other
side of the pedistle, obviously some way out, but obviously too deep
for any mere surface dweller.  The caves yet are huge, and large
enough to fit a half an emperial palace in.

A Circular Path in the Sewers~
{x here is a part of the circular tunnel path that is slightly
arched in by section in similarity to the other portions of the path.
The walls are plated with tan bricks, once natural stone caves, now
plated to an even domed over tunnel.  The sound of that cool water
flows between the two paths along side the wall, nearly three shaku
in length, for a plenty space to walk around.

{x Yet another curvy bend in the sewers, bending at a rounded
ninety degree angle with those tan large bricks domed over in a large
tunnel.  The sidewalks, perfectly parallel, sit along side those
walls with a cool steady stream of a deep river of water, once
naturally carved.  The sound of the trickling water fills the quiet
halls.

centuries ago.  Now covered with a rough tan brick that curves over
an arc for a top, and larger pillars that are against the wall to

made of metal, and able to be locked.  A single regular looking chair
sits here where the main officer sits as a watchman.

{x Here is a very dark and dank area of the Palace dungeon.  Not
well kept with all the geren mold and moss, and dust all over the

the top, at the corner edge with the cement and wood, that is the
ceiling.  The far Western end only has two doors to the North and
South made of steel and wood, and more light despite the glowing
torches lined along the thing hall.

there.  A large foot-locker sits down at each 3 layered mat sleeping

building, that is atetempted to be aired out with their large

moss, fungus, and hay on the ground and in a pile in that small cold
corner to hopefully keep the person who wants to sleep here warm. 
The only source of light is a tiny brick sized window here, however
there are bars at the top of the wall, seeming how the cell itself is
underground.  A set of chains and a wooden door lined with lead and
iron is all that is here to keep this prisoner here.

with plenty of light, a larger window with a viw of the garden.  The
room still is mossy and dirty, but has a small ragged blanked along
with the hay, but not many chains, just a thick lockable door of wood
and iron to the south.  With that large window, the smell slowly
drifts out, and the prisoners aren't in this cell for life, so with
comming and going prisoners, the room is never that rancid because of
so.

main square and South to the maingate.  Nothing but buildings line
the East and West wall.

head in and out of their houses, with children playing in the yards. 
To the South from this street can be seen the giant wooden gates of
Nakagau, leading out of the city.  To the North is the small raise of
the stone bricks, to the platform of the center barely seen.  There
are not many buildings, but minor ones upon this street, yet a rush
of people trample down from every direction.

The connection between the large walls at fifteen feet tall, and
painted a clean and kept white.  The walls have a large brown tile
interloafing roofs, over top of the large and heavily tick walls to
protect this large city.  The walls of the city circle throughout the
entire city perfectly, with the exception of the large wooden gate
that sits before you, which are usually left open to the public.  The
thick doors are constructed of an old durable oak that has withstood
attacks for many many years.  Not many people travel through the
gate, being loyal to their city.  Over the right pillar of the city
is a large watch tower to insight danger.

Before the Grand palace of the Daimyo~
{x Here is the end of the Karada street, and such a long stretch
the walk was.  The road ends with a large thick white fort wall.  The
wall stretches back around the large building that sits before you. 
There is a large set of iron cladded and barred gates to block your
path.  There is a thin space between the wall and the alley but not
large enough to squeeze through.  There is nothing, but a pair of
small lamps attached near the gates, by the walls which also light
your path with a light twinkling flame.  Through the gates seems like
a small paradise of a garden and a giant mansion for the dynasty. 
The road ends with a large block for the area of the square pattern
of brick like path.  It ends at the gates, in a large jagged circle,
where very few people wonder this area, unless they are tourists. 
Usually these large gates are left open for exploration of the
tourists and visitors.

perfectly round bushes of deep emerald green.  Beyond the bushes are
the trees standing tall with many seasonal colors.  To the North is a
large white two floor palace for the dynasty of the Daisho.  As you
walk down the path there are peiodically small stone gray lamps taht
raise up to waist level, radiating a small glow from the encased
glass.  To the eastern section are seen bamboo stocks, and to the

flickering flame to brighten any dark area.  The white buildings lie
all the way down the road, and spaced with small spaces for alley
ways, but usually a bad idea to go down.  To the east is seen a small
red torii, and the steps leading up to the Center Square of Nakagau.

grass , dependant on the season.  Black metal lamp posts line up and
down this single large street, people usually passing by.  Hanging

Kamae Street~
{x Slowly but surely, the long stretching street is comming to a
near at the Eastern part of the Kamae Street.  The Road is
constructed long ago of a fine and partially smooth rock of gray and
with a curve that leans up to the grass and gap of about 3-4 feet,
and then onto the well kept sidewalk of larger bricks, suprisingly
well kept.  Along the sidewalk, those fire lamps line to keep this
residential street lighted.

Kamae Street~
{x Here's yet another part of town, where the street is a fine
gray brick along with the upraise of sidewalk.  Here must be the
residential part of town, because there are quite the few houses, and
on the Eastern end, quite the larger houses.  To the North seems to
be the only house where a fine door on the house is, near a fine
pourch and a small sideyard with tall grass growing through.  To the
South is nothing but yards and parts of other houses.  Along the West
of the Kamae is yet to be seen more houses, getting smaller by each
house that goes by, so it seems.

blooming flowers and many cherry blossom trees, stretched up and out,
and trimmed fairly.  A small path of a deep small gray stone, With
tiny white pebbles surrounding the groomed stone.  Twisted and
distorded bushes lie around the large paths, with small blossoms.

periodically around the garden.  A large strange green jade rock sits
within the center of this area, looking rather decorative.  
To the west the garden contiues with a path to the north.

fish and meat market must be the to north that is radiating such a
bad smell.  The scent is very weak and only radiating from the door,
so it passes quickly.  Here is the Eastern Tebuki street, also busy
for the more necesities and training street.  The road is made of a
well pattenered and swept stone bricks, with large stone lanterns
with tiny flames lighting up at the night.  To the Northward window

Military and goveernment use, not as many people track down it
everyday although people still go down it.  A few lights and lamposts
lay on this street to light up the night path.  From South of here
can be seen a large building and nothing else than that.  And to the
North would be the splitting of Tebuki the commercial road to Migido.

cupboard and a sliding door to the left designed for overcoats.  From
the forth side there is few side halls to the north, and a long
stretching hallway and constructed of the same white wall stretched

table stretches from one side to the other of the gigantic dinning
room.  So large it looks like it could seat nearly Thirty people.  So
strange for it's culture though, for it only is Two and a half feet
tall,too short to sit at with a chair.  There are no chairs around
the table infact, only cushions of a silky and fluffy caliber. 
Around the Western wall are small but many windows with white
rice-paper to filter out most sunlight.  Many accomplishing peices of
artwork lie around the white walls of this room, with hanging weapons
and other peices of artwork.  Each Corner of the Dinning area is
filled with a strange but imperssive suit of armor from each grand
fallen general so not to be forgotten.  The delicious armoma of food
still occupies this area, the Kitchen must be near by.

The Alley, beside the Honda Residence~
{x Here is a rather dirty part of the alley, and one of the only
parts of the Alleys which you can easily walk into without squeezing.
Only about nine feet in length, between two houses, and filled with
dirt and crumbs.  A rather una-tractive dark part of the alley.  A
few nasty looking sacks lie in the alley, for what unusable garbage
there is.

Within the Alley way~
{x Here is a corner of a crack and sad looking small allyway, with
much dirt, and garbage.  It has previously been plated with bricks
and messy stones, but was dug up and never refixed.  From such
fertile ground many weeds and grass grow over through the cracks.

{x Here is behind where the large Honda House is, where the Honda
family resides.  With nothing but alittle junk and a heap of garbage
here, scattered about - consisting of bones, and old wasted peices of
food and broken items lay.  With the light has it's dark, and this
alley must obviously be it.  The alley is fairly crampte and dirty,
however a clean wooden old ladder sits here, leading up onto the roof
of the house.

black rounded tiles taht are cupped over otherones to prevent and
rain leakage.  There is dder, where the alley is to for.  The roofing
job in this particular house doesn't seem done..  Hammers, and more
bricks lay loosely up around, scattered about.

Ontop of the Honda Residence~
{x Here is the peek, or the summit of The Honda's square house. 
With their arching bricking job..  It was well done if it was
completely.  There are only about 10 more bricks to have been laid,
but for some reason there isn't anymore.  
Whoa!, it's quite slippery.. maybe that was the fate from the 
fate of one of the Hondas. The next House to the South looks Safer.

high, with a spiraling wooden staircase.  The woodenfloor is nicely
laid, with the white walls all around, painted brightly.  With the
large house, it could only make you wonder what the Matsuoka family
does, ..  Maybe carpenters, or maybe architects?  Whatever it is they
do, they must do well to keep such a lovely house.

few bedrooms along the northern wall, filled with space saving
cabinets and tatami mats.  The ceiling is lined by a special advanced

board and sanded smooth.  In the living room area is lined with red
