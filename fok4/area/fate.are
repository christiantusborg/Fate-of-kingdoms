0 TROLL TROLLS~
{RGeneral:{B:  Trolls.  The very name evokes nightmarish fears
and reverts many back to childhood tales of monsters
under the bridge and in the woods.  Trolls are this fearsome,
and then some.  Strong, tough, and nearly indestructible,
trolls are indeed nightmares given flesh.
{RPersonality:{B  Trolls are cruel and brutish.  They take what
they want, and few can stand before them to say differently.
Trolls revel in combat and warfare, and they excel in the
fine art of breaking heads.  Trolls will more often than not
act first and then think later, or just not bother to think at
all.  They're almost always hungry, and don't really care
what it is they eat.
{RPhysical:{B  Trolls can look like anything imaginable, really.
Usually though, they are roughly man-shaped, and stand
anywhere between seven and nine feet tall.  Troll skin is
very tough and leathery, and can come in any shade.  Their
thick necks support their tough skulls.  Trolls sometimes
have tusk-like teeth sticking out of their strong jaws.  Limbs
as powerful as oak trunks are just about as unbreakable.
Their large eyes can be any color, but are often red.  Troll
hair (when they have it) can be any hue and length.  The
troll race's toughness is equaled only by the mighty giants.
{RRelations:{B  Trolls are valued for their strength and are
often bought as mercenaries.  Buyer beware, however:
if a troll gets bored or thinks it can make more elsewhere,
it is as likely to fight its employer.  Orcs love the company
of trolls, and history tells tales of alliances between the
two in the past.  Good races loathe or fear trolls, and will
not usually deal with them.  
{RAlignment:{B  Trolls are evil...much more fun that way.
{RSpecial:{B  Trolls are hard to kill.  They regenerate amazingly
fast, so fast that some wounds close right as they're made.{x

0 ORC ORCS~
{RGeneral:{B:  Orcs are one of the most dangerous and warlike 
races in Theran history.  They have banded together at
various intervals in time, and the results are usually 
disastrous for the good races.  Orcs are the longtime enemies
of the elven and dwarven race, and are well known for
their toughness and excessive cruelty.
{RPersonality:{B  Orcs are warriors, born and bred.  They ofen
live in tribal communities, with a leader established by his
battle prowess.  They love to raid and pillage, taking great
pleasure in raising hell with civilization.  Orcs are not the
most intelligent race, but neither are they totally stupid.
They know enough to survive and overwhelm, and are
wholly capable of speech and writing, though most choose
not to bother with the latter.  Selowyn writes that the
orcan race were once elves, followers of an elf who 
walked the path of darkness.  For their profanation of
the gods, these elves were twisted into a dark form.  This
could help explain why elves and orcs are such enemies.
{RPhysical:{B  Orcs can come in all shapes and forms, but are
bipedal humanoids that are roughly man-sized, with forms
that are muscled and have a tough hide.  Their skin tones
are normally greenish, but can be grey, tan, or just about
anything.  Orcs also sport hair and sometimes facial hair,
but are just as often found to be totally bald.  They have
large, pointed ears, a throwback to their possible elven
heritage.  Their eyes can also be any color.
{RRelations:{B  Orcs associate best with other evil races, from
evil-minded men to draconians.  They are wary of drow,
for the dark elves often use orcs and other goblinoids as
slaves in their underworld kingdoms.  Orcs find kindred
spirits in trolls, and legend even speaks of a destructive
alliance between the two long ago.  Orcs sometimes
inter-breed with other races, and these progeny are most
often the product of rape.  Common half-orc mixes
include humans and elves.  Needless to say, the goodly
races of Thera often do not associate with orcs.
{RAlignment:{B  Orcs are evil, always.
{RSpecial:{B  Bloodthirsty orcs revive themselves by drinking
some blood from fallen enemies.  Also, they're incredibly
tough and adaptable, and therefore have learned to either
avoid or deal with arrow wounds.  They were never ones
to be afraid of a little infection...{x
~

0 OGRE OGRES~
{RGeneral:{B:  The ogre race is one comprised of muscular, powerful
humanoids.  They come from the outer fringes of Thera, banding
together in communities called "tribes".  The ogre way of life is one
that more civilized people would call barbaric, with simple laws
and swiftly meted justice.  They sometimes have problems fitting into
other societies and cultures.
{RPersonality:{B  Ogres respect strength and power, and have little use
for those who they see as weak.  Their minds are not fit for learned
pursuits, but they are far from stupid.  Some view the ogres as 
bloodthirsty and warlike, and this has some grain of truth to it.  Ogres
simply see things in a different worldview - there's right, there's wrong,
and those who are wrong should be crushed and driven before them.
Most ogres practice the art of the Blood Magik, and ancient and often
fell form of sorcery.  This grants them some special attributes.
{RPhysical:{B  The ogres are large humanoid creatures, with powerful
limbs and muscles like cords of steel.  Their skin is like a human's, only
thicker and tougher.  Ogres have strong, lantern-jaws and pointed
ears.  Their hair is often worn long, and can come in any shade of color.
Deep-set eyes are often blue or brown, but can also be any pigment.
Ogres stand around seven to nine feet tall, and are often as wide around
as two men.  It is speculated that ogres live as long as humans, perhaps
longer.  Nobody has ever questioned one.
{RRelations:{B  Ogres have strained relations at best with goodly races.  They
are often unsure how to approach humans and elves, as many legends
trace back to a common ancestry with them.  These legends say that
ogres were humans (or elves) that were cursed and turned more brutish
for their warring ways.  Ogres really don't care who they associate with,
and can often be found as mercenaries in armies.  Many evil races will
try to manipulate the ogres for their strength, but woe be unto them if
the ogres find out they've been duped.
{RAlignment:{B  Ogres find it easiest to tread the neutral or evil paths.
{RSpecial:{B  The aforementioned Blood Magiks allow the ogres to create
special totems.  These totemic constructs radiate an aura of fear, as
well as healing the ogre.{x 
~

0 GIANT GIANTS~
{RGeneral:{B:  Giants are the legendary warrior race of Thera, some of the
mightiest mortal fighters in history.  An evolutionary cousin to humans,
they resemble massive men and women.  It is unknown if the original
giantkin were created like they were, or were large humans that have
evolved into their own race.  Selowyn the Great's work, "Origins of
Theran Giantkin", was one of the many lost long ago in a great fire.
{RPersonality:{B  Giants value raw power and strength, and it is important
to them as a race that none be percieved as "weak", either in the eyes
of their peers or outsiders.  This does not mean they are bloodthirsty,
just that when push comes to shove, a giant will be ready to either
shove back or stand like a stone tower.  Most giants are loud and
boisterous, boasting of their great prowess.  Often this is just a face, 
because giants are also deeply introspective.  Their minds are not
suited to scholarly pursuits, but they still have a head for tactics and
planning, and they are fully capable of speech, writing and the arts.
In fact, the legend of the Thunderer and the Boneyard, a widely
known fable, was written by a giant.
{RPhysical:{B  Giants are huge, and extremely tough.  They look very
much like large humans, and have the same wide range of skin,
hair and eye colors as them.  Giants stand anywhere from nine
to twelve feet tall, and have heavily muscled frames.  They often
wear their hair long, but are as likely to be clean shaven as to
sport a massive beard.  Giantkin have booming voices, and a
great love of bawdy humor and valorous, tall tales.  There are
many branches of the giantkin race, each one having adapted to
the climate of their habitat - cloud, mountain, hill, frost, fire, desert
and stone giants being the most common.  
{RRelations:{B   Giantkin associate with the creatures of the mountains
most freely, and the valorous warrior races such as dwarves and
ogres.  Humanity and elvenkind has been both friend and enemy
of the giants, so they are often wary of them.  Giants can sometimes
be found as mercenaries in larger armies.  They remain largely
unconcerned with the rest of Thera's races.
{RAlignment:{B  Though they will fight for any cause they believe in
(especially if they get to fight), giants remain neutrally aligned.
{RSpecial:{B  A giant can use his size advantage to level an 
opponent with a crushing blow.  This does great damage, as well
as possibly sending the victim flying and knocking them out.{x

  I. Offline editing
 II. Fate of Kingdoms standards and Specifics
III. How NOT to build!


UPDATE:: Offline editing now requires a bit more
	 because of all teh changes to the code.
	 If you really need to, send me a note.
	 It will require much more work on your part.

I. Offline Editing and Area Importing for FOK, using MZF
     MakeZonesFast! or MZF, is a good editor with much
     compatability and potential to be even better in
     the future. It allows customization and saving areas
     from one format to another. It also gives wonderful
     debugging messages if you are converting an area
     to ROM2.4. That's right, ROM2.4, that basicly the
     area file format SS now uses. It used to be ROM2.3
     but I made so many changes that for some reason
     only ROM2.4 works now, great minds must think alike :p
     
     MZF can be picked up from the web at the following address
          http://www.goodnet.com/-esnible/mzf97a.zip
          			 ^---TILDE!

     (a) Converting an existing area to FOK' basic format
         [1] First of all you will need MZF and win95
         [2] When you have installed MZF, run it.
         [3] From the "File" menu select "File Format"
         [4] Select the format of the area you will be converting FROM
             (if you are not sure, try different ones)
         [5] When you have the area opened, select "File Format" again
         [6] This time you will select ROM2.4
         [7] Then select "Save as Rom2.4" from the "File" menu
         [8] Type in the filename, use a different name or extension
             {I use *.r24 so I do not get confused)
         [9] If you got errors on step [7] then try following...
               => Save the file as Merc format...then quit the program
               => Run the program and open the merc file you saved
               => Then save THAT file as Rom2.4
                    (this will occur with rom2.3 files mostly     )
                    (at this time MZF is a bit sketchy with rom2.3)
     ****Finally, when you have the area save in ROM2.4 format you will
     ****have to change the header of the file. see part (c)
     ****below on "FINAL CHANGES". This is IMPORTANT! yet simple...
      ---(When you convert areas for use with FOK
          you must also make sure the vnums in the
          area are unique to it and also the the
          area does not call for any vnums out of
          its range. This includes, exits, rooms,
          mobs, objects, portal values and resets.)---

               
     (b) Creating a new area with MZF for use on FOK
          [1] Select "File Format" from the "File" menu
          [2] Select ROM2.4 and make your area
          [3] When you area is done, simply select
              "Save as ROM2.4" from the "File" menu
              (you may have to reselect "File Format")
          [4]
     ****Finally, when you have the area save in ROM2.4 format you will
     ****have to change the header of the file. see part (c)
     ****below on "FINAL CHANGES". This is IMPORTANT! yet simple...
                        
     (c) FINAL CHANGES necessary to new files AND converted files    
          [1] The File Header...
              You will have to edit the first few lines of the area file
              You can use a text editor for this and save it as text
              Area files are not code or anything they are just text!

       Replace these old lines with the new ones
       and the information to reflect your area.
       ALL '-' ARE TILDES!!! (shift and the key to left of the 1 key)
	
	<<<UPDATE>>> :: You do NOT have to change the area header stuff,
		        Code has been added to read it both of the above
		        ways, but you should aedit it when the area is in

                    These changes must be made...
                    They are in the first few lines of the file
                    Be careful waht you type...
                    The first two lines are the same.
                    But you must add a "Builders <yourname>-" line
							   ^---TILDE!!
                    and then a "VNUMs <number> <number>" line
                    the first number is the areas lowest vnum
                    and the second is the highest vnum, all
                    items/objects/mobs etc must have their
                    own vnums otherwise the area is useless
                    and will crash the mud.

                    Check the mud first using alist and find yourself
                    a range of vnums that is the size you need.
                    Then make sure you tell us which ones you are building 
                    for so no one accidently decides they want that range
                    as well. If such a thing happens, as it often does
                    when converting areas
          When you have that done, you area will be ready to put in.
          Once in, you can use OLC to edit small changes as needed,
          especially for things i have coded as unique to FOK.
          This includes races, and other little things like
          hidden items, and all of the other more specialized flags.
          There are a few of em...                                 
              So, for example, you want to make an
              item of type "ornament" which is hidden.
               
              Just make the item with MZF and make it type trash
              or whatever, then when the area is installed on the
              mud you can make the small changes necessary with olc.

           When you have the area made you can send it to me
           as a text attachment to takeda@mathlab.sunysb.edu
           If you send it as an actuall "text" "attachment"
           I will think highly of you, and the mud will be much
           better since I have more time to code rather than messing
           with your areas...the linux/unix program "PINE"
           works well for this, and so does NETSCAPE
           as well as many other programs I think....
           If your mail reader formats attachments as MIME encoded,
           like Myrthynkyne, that is ok too, just as long as you send
           it to takeda@mathlab.sunysb.edu, the server the mud is on

	<<Other Things Specific to FOK>>

	=>VNUMS
	   Use unique vnums, find some with vlist...
	   area vnum ranges will always start with XX01 and end with XX99
	=>Falling Objects Code
	    All objects that a TAKE flagged will fall DOWN one room
	    per tick until they get to a room that is NOT AIR or
	    until they get to a room with no down flag. So, all air
	    sectors should have down exits, even if they are one way.
	    They should go to a room which will lead down and which
	    would be logical for it to to.
	=>Hidden Flag for Objects 	
	    Items can be HIDDEN flagged and will appear hidden in the room.
	    Such items can be found by searching. Room 419 has an example
	    of a hidden hole (type portal), whihc leads to room 420.
	=>Repop Chances
	    You can set an objects repop value in OLC, from 1 to 100
	    This is used to see whether or not an object will reset.
	=>Mobile Names
	    Do not use the name of a player or god in the NAME section
	    of a mobile, you can use a god/player name elsewhere though.
	    The NAME section is the keyword list part...
		i.e. Name [acolyte]        <---- NO TAKEDA HERE
		     ShortDesc: An Acolyte of Takeda
		     LongDesc: An Acolyte of Takeda is here.
	=>Vlist
	    When making new areas, use VLIST to show a list
	    of what areas occupy what vnum blocks.
	    The blocks are listed in vnums of 100, and areas
	    must have a room numbered XX01, so for block
	    4, which is the gargoyle tap house (400-499)
	    there is a room number 401, the area simply must
	    have this because vlist uses this to see what
	    areas are where. Also, when your area takes up
	    over one block (over 100 vnums), you should put
	    in temporary rooms in each 100 vnum block.
	    So if you have an area planned for vnums 1000-1599
	    (blocks 10-15 on vlist), you should make the following
	    temp rooms so people dont steal your vnums...
		1001, 1101, 1201, 1301, 1401, & 1501
	=>Exlist
	   A very useful command for listing exits to and
	   from the area you are in, shows one ways in and out
	   as well as 2 ways...use it...love it...
	=>Map
	   Map is a very useful command which shows an ascii map.
	   Also, this map code adds to the FOK building standards.
	   No overlap rooms outside of CITY sectors are going to
	   be allowed, mazes are find of course. Also, a new
	   sector type has been added, ROAD, for... roads
	=>Wilderness Building, update of Map paragraph
	   The world of Thera consist of 5k rooms, we have
	   about 7k of non wilderness rooms in areas at the
	   time of this writing. The world is round! heh.
	   Areas are linked to wilderness rooms like normal.
 	   but in the rooms that link to wilderness the sector type
	   must be type enter. In the wilderness, midgaard is represented
	   as a single character on the ascii map, all areas will be 
	   like this. Go out each midgaard gate and into midgaard
	   from each direction on the wilderness map to see what it is 
	   supposed to be like.
		UPDATE::
		The main wilderness can have links to other wildernesses
		say you create an area 'Subterranean Tunnel' vnums 100-199.
		on the world.are 4900 room map (vnums 20001-24900), you 
		would simply have a link to that area...
		the part of that area you want to be wilderness would be
		flagged as wilderness AND the appropraite sector flag
		the entrances/exits from all wilderness area to other

		from the main wilderness a character would enter your area

  @		at position 3,1 is a link to your actual area

This is a weak example but I hope you get the idea...
some uses for this might be...a hidden valley, underground passage,
a grand bridge, or castle...whatever...

	=>Wset
	  Use the wset command to set the default description and name
	  for the room your are in. It is for wilderness rooms only.
	  Any room descriptions you write for wilderness room will be
	  saved of course, unless you wset over them. And finally,
	  when you are done wsetting, make sure you save the world.are 
          file with an asave area while in the wilderness.

	=>traps
	  new item type added for traps, ITEM_TRAP, it is set up
	  in olc like everything else. Damage from a trap is based
	  on the traps level. So do not go making them too lethal.
	  Traps also have a number of charges (which they reset at)
	  (like wands, they have charges that work the same way)	  
	  Also, you can not pick up traps unless you are immortal

	=>Worth (of an area)
	  Areas now have a worth value, from 0 to 100.
	  Most areas will have worth values of 0 which will
	  mean they can not be taken over by clans, those that
	  have a value above 0 will give profit/taxes
	  to their Owner(also a new field) every realtime hour.
	  100 is a very high value, meant only for very rich cities, etc..

	=>Area Takeovers
	  One rule I must enforce...
	  You will NOT edit the resets of ANY room with a clan symbol
	  or any clan guardians in it. This will cause much havoc, so
	  do NOT edit any rooms with clan symbols or guardians in them

	=>Object Condition
	  Editing of an objects repop condition was added to olc,
	  this is the condition at which the object repops...
	  specific instances of that object have their own condition
 	  which goes up and down with wear and repair. An objects
	  condition should only be set with olc if it needs to be.
 	  Most condition will be set at 100, but there may be cases
	  when you want some to repop somewhat worn...use it then :)

III. How NOT to build, images of a coders nightmare
     
My favorite section, and often least payed attention to...
     
Make your rooms direction insensitive unless there is only one exit.  If
a room has a south exit and a west exit, the line 'You enter through the
southern door' is a bad line.  However, if the southern door is the only
entrance to the room, it's permissible.  Also, if you are using one way
doors, direction sensitivity is permissible.

Also, a room doesn't know if you've seen it before, so avoid lines like
'you gaze on the mighty mirror of Zenabit for the first time'.

Avoid putting sentiments into the mind of the reader.  If the line has
'you think' in it, it's probably bad, since you don't know if that's really
what they think.  Try to convey things in another manner as to make them
think what you want them to think.

Avoid pointless anachronism.  It's tacky.  Areas should have some
internal logic, as well as logic to the rest of the world, instead of
just being a lump of anachronism to provoke a titter the first time, and
gradually to become tiresome.  Strive for cleverness and wit instead.

Put in extra descriptions in rooms especially, but also on objects.  It
fleshes the area out more.  Overdo extra descs rather than underdoing
them.

Write utility linker rooms.  If you have a long and winding road going
up to the castle -- write at least a couple of road rooms.  Be sure to say
'the castle to the north' and not 'the castle in front of you' since the
person might have left it.

Write 'useless' objects for colour.  If the princess is the sort to wear
perfume, put some type furniture perfume in a type object vanity table
that could be found if looked for.  It too fleshes out the world.  (Note
that Satin wrote 600 useless objects for Cordreas Heart, but you don't have
to be asthorough (read, insane) as her.  ;)

If there's furniture in a room, write it as an object and load it there,
so that it could be sat on/etc.

If you have no_take objects (such as the donation pit) or mobs that
cannot be killed and are sentinel (shopkeepers, adepts, etc.) write them
as normal objects/mobs, consider giving them no long description, just a -,
              (which would be a TILDE, of course *whimpers aout tildes)--^
and describe them as part of the room, to blend them into the world more.
If the mob can be killed, or the object taken, though, you should give it a
long desc, since it might not be there.

Do NOT write descriptions of a mobile into the room description if you
also load that mobile in the area.  Do not do the following:

<room desc>
You are in a throne room.  A huge gold throne with the king of the
goblins sitting on it is in front of you.  He cries out and several
bodyguards attack!

Instead do:

<room desc>
You are in a throne room.  A huge gold throne is immediately in front of
you.  Tapestries depicting the greatness of the ruler whose castle you have
intruded hang on all walls.
<mobile>
The king of the goblins is here.  He cries for help!
<mobiles>
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
A bodyguard screams and attacks!

NEVER write an area that is too easy, or that has absurdly powerful
equipment, just to make it popular.  Do not rely on a mobile being 'really
tough' as the sole balance to an otherwise overpowered item

84 RENAME~
Syntax: Rename <player> <new name>
 
Renaming a character are used in these cases:
 
>When a player creates a character that has a
name that is considered illegal in some way.
 
>When a player (of higher than lvl 1) may need a 
name change.  This may occur in many cases but
take into deep consideration before renaming a 
player.  
 
When you rename a player make a note of it on board 1 stating old and 
new name.  Unless you rename a character for having an illegal name.
~

0 HOMETOWN HOMETOWNS REGISTRY~
Syntax:	hometown				(shows cost)
	hometown <city>			     (sets hometown)

Hometown commands may be done at a registry. Your hometown is where you
will recall to and is where the pit is to which your corpse will decay. 
It costs a certain amount of gold dependant on how reknown you are.

0 ROLEPLAY ROLEPLAYING 'ROLE PLAYING' ROLE-PLAYING ROLE~
Roleplaying means to create and act as another character.
Much like in acting you develop another persona and move them about
this make believe world. As a character, you should constantly be in that
character's mind and say and act as that character would. Though you can
adopt chracteristics from yourself, the fun in playing a character is
acting like someone else. This character is not you, so should not say
things you know about but that they couldn't, like the existence of
airplanes or who one of your other characters might know but the one
your playing currently doesn't. Which basically means keep each
chracters knowledge separate. Each character has their own memories and
thoughts. There is never a reason to say things that your character, as
a real person would not understand. This is called speaking out of
character, ooc. Do you sit around and talk about how many hitpoints your
dog or friend has? Neither would your character. This is a game, and a
great deal of the enjoyment comes from playing. Most of this playing
should involve your role. It is up to you to create this role, you can
be as simple or as wild and creative as you like, the further you take
should involve your role. It is up to you to create this role, you can
be as simple or as wild and creative as you like, the further you take
it the better. Once you've created a basic character idea start thinking
of ways you can play it out. Does your character have any personality quirks?
Maybe they're afraid of sharp objects so they never use swords. What about
speech characteristics or mannerisms? These are up to you, and we expect
you to create them. A strong emphasis will be placed on roleplaying and
anyone who expects to be in any worthy positions should have a strong 
character. If you are having trouble creating a character ask for help.

Also, here at the Fate of Kingdoms you affect the outcome of the game. If
the entire populace is complaining that the Full Circle Coliseum is just
to small then the stranger who runs the place might consider expanding it.
If the maids of a certain castle are always being killed then they might 
add to the castle defenses or even close themselves down. This is not to
say killing mobs will be punished. But, if anotehr player is the keeper
of this castle and he/she does a good enough job roleplaying it, then
he/she might well get what he/she asks for. Players affect the story in
whatever way they choose. You just have to be convincing enough. Have at it!
~

0 MERCENARY MERCENARIES~
Mecenaries are an enterprising bunch. They are not Warriors, nor Thieves,
nor Assassins. They take advantage of the politics of every situation in
hopes of monetary gain. Working on both sides of a conflict, the Mercenary
is always neutral. Unlike Assassins who are in it for the thrill, these
killers and bounty hunters are in it for the coin. A Mercenary, needless
to say, is a skilled combatant. In fact. the most skilled of them even
learn how to backstab, to aid even more in the fulfillment of contracts.
~

0 INQUISITOR INQUISITORS~
Inquisitors are clerics driven to irrationality and sometimes even madness.
Taking up many of the thieves skills, Inquisitors quest to destroy the
enemy by all means possible. The enemy may be anyone or anything. Their
distorted minds often create enemies, good or evil. The Inquisitors are
very chaotic. When an Inquisitor makes a decision, however irrational,
he or she will carry out that decision relentlessly and without thought 
of re-evaluation. They are the zealous witch-hunter types. Watch out.
~

0 SPELLFILCHER SPELLFILCHERS~
Spellfilchers are a class dabbled up by mischevious Pixies. Originally.
Pixies of this guild spent most of their time breaking into towers and
castles stealing what magics and knowledge they could before returning
to the forest to reap the benefits of their plunder. Spellfilcher magic
deals with thievery and the enhancement of it. The Spellfilcher class
is the mixed breed of the magic world. They dabble in many magics,
none of extreme power. On the other hand though, they are fairly well
versed in melee combat. Spellfilchers are masters of what they do and
watched closely by the other Mage classes, as well as the Thieves guild.
~

0 PRODIGY PRODIGIES~
The Prodigy class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes
from his or her deity, the Prodigy derives all of his or her power from
within. The Prodigy harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces
which infuse his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions
that a Prodigy can practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be 
used on other players. The Prodigy guild is a new one, founded by the
scribe for those few of youth deemed gifted. Many of the original guild 
have grown in the decade since the guilds founding. No longer is the guild
purely good, the temptations could not be resisted.
~

0 MALIGNER MALIGNERS~
Maligners, those who choose at all costs the path of darkness. Cursed, or
blessed depending on your point of view. The dark gods bestowed upon these
few, powers of black and negative magics. They hold much power, but bare 
much responsability. It is rumored that once, one Maligner turned from
being evil, he did not even turn to good, just neutral. Believing he was 
upsetting the balance, He was slain by a god on the spot, his powers taken
and marked on his forehead and left to bare eternal shame. Those thinking
of studying in this art should be forewarned, the sacrifice is great.
~

0 MAGE MAGES~
Mages are the traditional casting class of the pure magic. 
Mages practice numerous different kinds of magics. Yet, 
they seem to focus the most on combat magics. The Mage 
class is an extremely complext class. They put forth much 
time in effort into combat spells. Because of the amount of 
time they spend learning the utmost importance of these 
spells they have became very protective over them. Sharing 
a spell is like showing your combat stratagey.
 
The Mage class is a complex and diverse bunch. They vary in 
persona to such a high degree that one member of the guild 
can hardly consider another member a friend. It is partially 
because of this they keep thier spells to themselves and hold 
them in such high regards.
 
Mages have what is considered to be a combatic approach 
to magic. Which means that they do not practice the magics 
of healing nor many of the defensive magics. 
~

0 PALADIN PALADINS~
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all
others. This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and
healing powers. They are also formidable fighters, always questing to
stamp out evil. Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.
Those who forsake goodness are frowned upon. Paladins are expected to be
truthful, chivalrous, humble, merciful, kind, bold, and noble of spirit.
Paladins are always Lawful and Good. They are as zealous as the
Inquisitor, but they appreciate their direction, however rash. With the
exodus of the knights of the old kingdom, Paladins are having hard time
fulfilling their vows to society.
~

0 'BLACK KNIGHT' BLACK_KNIGHT BKNIGHT BKNIGHTS~
The opposite of Paladins, these heathen have chosen evil as their course.
Such fervor and zeal gives them deadly spells to compliment their already
superb fighting skills. They seek only personal gain and to cause
suffering and pain to good. Black Knight must stay evil in order to cast
their spells.  Those who forsake evilness are frowned upon. Keeping
themselves up to their standards as ruthless, they have learned to cleave
opponents clear in half. They often brag sickeningly that if it were not
for helpless boys and girls they would never half learned this vile skill.  
~

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors strive for combat and the thrill of battle.  Thus, the
reason they focus their training on the utter most complex maneuvers
of the compounded art of combat.  Due to their intense training they
are considered elite fighters throughout the realms.  They are able
to learn to sucessfully wield the widest variety of weapons.  Along
with, making themselves masters of all forms of melee combat.  
 
The warrior guild consists of a extreme diverse bunch. Yet, 
they all share the same abilities. Warriors possess ultra quick 
and drastic painful weapon attacks. Which goes along nicely 
with their superb parrying and blocking make them the 
ultimate at what they do. 
 
Warriors have a straightforward approach to battle. Which 
gives them the chance to be hired as soliders and guards. 
The weapon of a warrior, to them, is held in the highest 
regard to themself. 
~

0 THIEF THIEVES~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other
class, but have the widest range of skills available. Thieves are
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering
areas undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread. They
are better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of
warriors. However, when a thief gets the jump on you, you had better watch
yourself. Their dreaded backstab and annoying blackjack makes them quite
the fear instilling opponent.  Then they learn to dual backstab and the
fear of their enemies turns to panic.  
~

0 RANGER RANGERS~
Outdoorsmen, hunters, masters of woodcraft, Rangers are the guardians of
the forests.  In addition to having excellent fighting skills, they are
also wielders of some powerful magic.  Some Rangers have been known to
call large bears to their aid, fashion mystical staves, and be able to
camouflage beyond detection. In additon to camouflage, Rangers also learn
how to ambush their foes, giving them quite a surprise, as well as loss of
blood.  Rangers are survivors and adapters. However, you will rarely find
them inside city limits and they often make better friends with animals
than with any so called "sentient" life. Rangers see the city as something
evil or unnatural. Nature is a Rangers home, and the animals their family.
~

0 HUM HUMAN HUMANS~
{RGeneral:{BMost humans are the ancestors of pioneers, conquerors,
traders, travselers, refugees, and other people physically, culturally, 
religiously, and politically. Hardy or fine, light-skinner or dark, 
showy or austere, primitive or civilized, devout or impious, 
humans run the gamut.
 
{RPersonality:{BHumans are the most adaptable, flexible, and ambitious 
people among the common races.  They are diverse in their tastes, morals, 
customs, and habits. Others accuse them of having little respect 
for history.  But it's only natural, that humans, with their relatively 
short life spans and constantly changing cultures would have a 
shorter collective memory then dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings.
 
{RPhysical Description:{BHumans typically stand from 5 feet to a 
little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. With men 
noticeably taller and heavier then women. Thanks to their penchant 
for migration and conquest, and to their short generations, humans 
are more physically diverse the n other common races, with skin shades 
that run from nearly black to very pale, hair from black  to blond 
(curly,kinky,straight), and facial (for men) from sparse to thick
plenty of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood and they may demonstrate 
hint of eleven, orc or other lineages. Humans are Often ostentatious or 
unorthodox in their grooming and dress, sporting unusual hairstyle, 
fanciful clothes tattoos, body piercings, and the like, Humans have 
short life spans, achieving majority at about 15 and rarely living even 
a single centurty.
 
{RRelations:{BJust as readily they mix with each other, humans mix with 
members of other races. Among the other races, humans are known as 
"everyone's second-best friends." They serve as ambassadors, 
diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kind.
 
{RAlignment:{BHumans tend toward no particular alignment, not even neutrality. 
The best and worst are found among humans.
 
{RLanguage:{BHumans speak Common. Trey typically learn other languages, 
including obscure ones, and trey asre found of spinkling their 
speech with words borrowed from other tongues : Orc curses,   
Eleven musical expression, Dwarven military phrases, and so on.
 
{RNames:{BHuman names vary greatly, without unifying deity to give them 
a touchstone for their culture, and with such a fast breeding cycle,
 humans mutate socially at a fast rate. Humans culture, therefore, 
is more diverse then other cultures, and no human names are 
truly typical.  Some human's parent gives their children dwarven 
or eleven names (pronounced more or less correctly).

0 TROLL TROLLS SWAMP 'SWAMP TROLL' 'SWAMP TROLLS'~
Used in stories to frighten children, in war stories to impress bar lasses
and as sources of humor in puppet shows, the troll is always a villain for
the "civilized" world.  Standing well over the tallest human, their
monstrous looks and unclean smell have earned them this image.
Living in low and dark swamplands, the troll have grown used to the dark
acrid air and can see very well without light. Being some of the most hearty
of many of the races, few wounds ever are deep enough to cause long term
damage to a troll. Though the fact brings much fear into human infantry,
it is now well known that fire and acid cause great damage to these brutes.
Due to their nature, all trolls are evil.  And because of their lack of
proper learning, they are often to dull to become learned in the ways of
magely sorcery.  They are among the strongest of all the races and are not
thought to live exceedingly long lives, perhaps even less than a humans.
Swamp trolls also have the instinctive ability to detect all that is "good".
~

0 DUERGAR~
{RGeneral:{B:  Duergar are the sinister cousins to the dwarven race.
They are to dwarves what drow are to elves - a dark mirror.
The duergar live underground in the deep, fell places of the
world, overseeing their goblinoid slaves as they dig for gems
and precious adamantite.  
{RPersonality:{B  The dark dwarves are very greedy and covetous.
They mine and desire gems and gold, like the dwarves.  But
where dwarves wish to find these things to make wonderful
creations, duergar wish to own them so nobody else can.
They are a bit more intelligent than their dwarf cousins, and
much sneakier.  Duergar will not lift a finger if they can find
an easier way.  This general laziness leads to them having a
slightly weaker constitution than a dwarf.  In general, a
duergar will rely on trickery and skullduggery than a direct
attack.
{RPhysical:{B  Duergar have ashen-grey skin and hair that is
usually white, grey or solid black.  Their deep-set eyes
are normally amber, but can be any color.  Duergar stand
the same height as dwarves, around three and a half to
four feet tall.  They are often seen sporting beards, but do
not put as much pride in facial hair as a dwarf.  Duergar
women do not grow beards, contrary to popular myth.
{RRelations:{B  Dwarves despise duergar, and consider them
an embarassment.  Elves and humans are also wary of
the dark dwarves.  Duergar are the sometimes allies, 
sometimes enemies of the drow.  They are very careful
of the illithids, for they share the underworld with them
but do not understand their vast mental powers.  Mutual
hatred of dwarves will sometimes make allies out of the
orcs, but these alliances are never very permenant.
{RAlignment:{B  Its easy to be evil, therefore duergar are.
{RSpecial:{B  Duergar are the masters of the cheap shot.
They know how to strike where an enemy's defenses
are weakest, therefore delivering a critical strike.{x
~

0 DROW~
{RGeneral:{B:  Dark Elves.  Night Elves.  Drow.  Whatever
they're called, the drow are one of the most feared
races on the face of Thera.  The night elves are the
stuff of chilling tales, grim-faced, red-eyed spectres
from the belly of the world come to slaughter in the
dead of night without a sound.  Their victims often never
see or hear their doom coming.  Drow were actually
part of the first sentient Theran races, along with the
elves.  A great rift between the two drove the drow
underground, and the rest is history.  Of special note
is the fact that the word "drow" is used to denote the
singular and the plural.
{RPersonality:{B  Drow are the personification of evil.  They
are one of the most vile, cruel and diabolical races ever.
Drow care about one person:  themselves.  They come
from their myriad of underground paradises, an intricate
connection of cruelly beautiful cities and palaces.  They
are creatures of darkness, and thus do not enjoy being
in the light.  In fact, it often takes them a few years to
even adjust their eyes to stand being outside in the daytime
in the Theran overland.  Drow do not want, they covet.
Drow do not love, they lust.  Drow do not desire, they take.
{RPhsyical:{B  The dark elves are one of the most beautiful 
races.  They are tall, graceful and slender, with lithe frames
and captivating eyes.  Drow skin is dark, with tones ranging
from charcoal-grey to total night-black.  Their hair is usually
stark white or silver, with some variations of black.  Black
hair is very rare among the drow, and those born with it
are expected to achieve great power.  Their almond-shaped
eyes are dazzling in their luminescence, with colors that 
range from green to purple to amber (the most common).
Drow live for many generations.
{RRelations:{B  Most races are wary of the drow, and for good
reason.  They know a drow will keep his tongue in your ear
while he plunges the knife in your back.  Dark elves relate
often with other underland races, such as duergar and the
illithids.  Even then, they try to subjugate and command
these races, so alliances such as those are tentative at best.
Dwaves despise drow, and often battle with them in the
deep places of the world.  A special hate is reserved for
the elven race.  The drow were long ago sundered from
their light elf kin, and they have not forgotten those ancient
wars.  Rare circumstances have to happen for an elf and
a drow to even be civil to one another.
{RAlignment:{B  It is not a question of if a drow is evil, its just
to what degree.
{RSpecial:{B  Drow are attuned with the night, and thus they
can see in total darkness without the aid of a light.  They
also find it easier to fight in the night time.{x

0 PIXIE PIXIES~
{RGeneral:{B:  Pixies are a small, mischevious and highly magical race of
fairy folk.  They are very quick-witted and intelligent, and are one
of the most magically-oriented races on Thera.  Selowyn writes that
the pixies were created by the goddess Silvara for her own amusement,
a beautiful creature to serve as her messenger and emissary.  They have
since then come into their own as a race.
{RPersonality:{B  The pixies may be small in size but they are usually huge 
in personality.  They are often playful and always inquisitive, eager to
learn new secrets and truths. Once a pixie is a friend, they are so for
life.  Pixies excel at magical arts, and though they are physically weak,
their casting prowess is rarely equaled or excelled.   Pixies have a soft
spot for pretty items, and love to discover new things.
{RPhysical:{B  Pixies are very small, standing maybe only a foot or so in
height.  Their lightweight frames weigh virtually nothing.  Pixies have
large, luminescent wings and are almost always in motion.  Their hair
and eyes are vibrant and bright, no matter what the color.  Pixies 
seem to have a constant magical aura of eldritch light around them.
Their keen eyes can pierce the veil of Thera, allowing them to detect
good from evil, see camoflauged and invisible things, and innately
detect all things magical.
{RRelations:{B  Pixies relate well with elves, and share a fay kinship with
the Fair Folk.  They also love to talk with the darnoks, and share
extradimensional experiences with them.  Pixies will try to get along
with nearly any race, with varying results.  Some truly evil beings,
such as drow, orcs and illithid, are a lost cause to the fairy folk.
{RAlignment:{B  Pixies can be good or neutral.
{RSpecial:{B  Pixies have become adept at using their size to their
advantage, flittering out of harm's way.  This is an extra dodge
skill.{x

0 GRFFN GRIFFIN~
The Griffin, Gargoyle, and Draconian races are said to have migrated to the
Theran midlands during a dark epoch of confusion and severance a few thousand
years ago. Coming from the drab outer stretches beyond Thera, these races had
a difficult time adjusting when Thera brought itself from that dismal age.
Not having found their niche, these races still act as they did in their
ancient homeland.

Griffin are virtuous beast with a lion's body, an eagle's head, and wings.
These commingled creatures pursued the Draconians when they left their land
to prey on the innocent of Thera's midland. Before their dispersion to Thera,
Griffen were but a myth, as were their Draconian and Gargoyle counterparts.
However, Griffin are presently famed for their interminable fight against
evil, especially their enemies of yore, the Draconians. Griffen can detect
all that are evil without effort and have full use of their efficient wings.
~

0 GARGO GARGOYLE GARGOYLES~
{RGeneral:{B  The gargoyles (or "gargoi", as the plural is sometimes spoken) are
a highly unique race.  They are a physically strong and tough people, and most
often resemble living, winged statues.  Though they are not actually made of
stone, they can turn into solid rock at will.  
{RPersonality:{B  Gargoyles, having migrated to Thera countless generations ago
from their own land of strife, have adopted a neutral stance on almost all
matters.  Their even, collected minds can often see both sides of an issue.
When the gargoi first came to Thera, they quickly associated themselves
with the humans, the most accepting of races.  Gargoyles then became
the sworn protectors of humankind.  While they no longer serve in that
role, gargoyles are still very defensively minded, and will often stand up
for the downtrodden.  Gargoi culture values strength greatly, be it of
the body or the mind.  Strength and valor honor their gods, especially
Derkec, the patron deity of the gargoyles.
{RPhysical:{B  Gargoyles most often appear to be powerfully built, bipedal 
humanoids. Their most prominent feature is their wings, and these resemble
wyvern wings.  Gargoi have the innate ability to fold and morph
these wings into their shoulderblades, thus allowing them to pass much
easier among the cities of man.  Their skin tones are often stone colored,
with granite-like greys, dusky sandstones and milky marbles.  Gargoi
eye colors are very bright, with brilliant shades of green, red and blue.
Their hair can be any color.  It is not known how long garogyles live.
{RRelations:{B  Gargoyle associate best with humankind, dwarves and elves.
They consider these to be the nobler Theran races.  Giants are also
counted among friends of the gargoi.  Gargoyles are mostly neutral
on the subject of any other races.
{RAlignment:{B  Gargoyles are neutral, and make good arbiters and
chroniclers.
{RSpecial:{B  Gargoyles can turn into solid stone at will.  This acts as both
a protective shield and healing cocoon.{x

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to. The numbers for [<mad # in area>] and
<max # in room> will default to 1 if no number is entered.
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.
If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' BOARD 'NOTE SYSTEM' BOARDS~
Syntax:

board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
note                                    Reads next note.
note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note write                              Posts a note.
note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board
read.

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board,
there are several, each with its special purpose.

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number
of unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level. 
(no other recipients may appear in that case).

You can now send notes addressed to an entire kingdom, same as personal.
To send notes to an entire kingdom simply addressnotes to that kingdom
on the personal board just as you would send notes to any other person.
~

0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

84 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.

Syntax: where pk

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters. If pk switch is used, WHERE command 
will only show the players near you that are in your PK ranger

When in the *wilderness* the where command syntax and output is the same,
except that it only checks for "victims" inside a 10x10 block which
is centered at the person who does the command,..you! :)
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

See also: LOCKTITLE
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.

Syntax:  consider <target>
 
CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing your target.
Of course, it is only a rough estimate.
~

0 VISIBLE~

and camouflage making you visible again.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to gods for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.

Recalling back to hometown is a spell. But all players below level 10th 
may use this spell by the help of the gods. The gods transfer the players 
below level 10, by only their praying. You must be calm enough to 
concenterate and pray to the gods, so you are not able to pray not 
only in the fights, but also sometime after a fight. Those who are over 
level 10 must find a way to cast the spell to recall.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
As of now you have to search for the correct practitioner to be able to
improve your skills. There are no more guild masters.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session every 5th level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

84 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

84 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

84 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

84 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

~

84 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

90 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

84 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

84 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 84 force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

84 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

84 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

84 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

84 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

84 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

84 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

84 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, corpses).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

84 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

90 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

84 transfer~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

84 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

84 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

84 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

84 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

84 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

84 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

MWHERE shows you the locations of all mobiels specified in syntax.
~

84 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

84 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: poofout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

84 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

84 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

82 IMMTALK :~
Syntax:  immtalk <message>
             : <message>
 
Sends a message to all immortals that are online at the present 
time.  
 
Syntax:  immtalk
 
Turns on/off the immtalk channel.
~

84 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~

0 BLESS~
Syntax: cast bless <character>
Syntax: cast bless <object>

This spell improves the to-hit roll and saving throw versus spell of the
target character by 1 for every 8 levels of the caster. It may also be
cast on an object to temporarily bless it (blessed weapons, for example,
are more effective against demonic beings).
~

0 'COLOUR SPRAY', 'MAGIC MISSILE', 'WRATH', 'MULTIBURST', 'MULTI'~
Syntax: cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
Syntax: cast 'magic missile'  <victim>
Syntax: cast 'wrath'          <victim>
Syntax: cast 'multiburst'     <victim>

These spells inflict damage on the victim.  The higher-level spells do
more damage.  COLOUR SPRAY is the weakest while MULTIBURST is the
strongest.  COLOUR SPRAY has a small chance of blinding its victim and
will decrease in the amount of given damage the more it is used.  Wrath
only damages evil mobs and will have a small chance of cursing them.
MULTIBURST, the strongest spell, releases a burst of magic missiles
whose level of damage depends on the caster's level.  Although the spell
can be weak at first, at high levels, it's the strongest of these spells.
~

0 'DEADLY VENOM'~
Syntax: cast 'deadly venom'
 
This spell turns the room into a poisonous marsh that has chances of
poisoning you. This spell affects the room itself and casts the spell
POISON on you continuously. The only spell that can cancel this effect
is SANCTIFY LAND. The smartest thing to do is to get out of the room.
~

0 'CAUSE LIGHT' 'CAUSE SERIOUS' 'CAUSE CRITICAL' HARM~
Syntax: cast 'cause light'    <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cause serious'  <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cause critical' <victim>

more damage.

This spell changes the sex of the victim (temporarily).
~

0 'CHARM PERSON'~
Syntax: cast 'charm person' <victim>

This spell inflicts damage on the victim and also reduces the victim's
strength by one.
~

0 'CONTINUAL LIGHT'~

~

0 'CURE POISON'~
Syntax: cast 'cure poison' <character>

This spell cures poison in one so unfortunate.
~

0 CURSE~
Syntax: cast 'curse' <character>
Syntax: cast 'curse' <object>

This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells.
It also renders the character unclean in the eyes of gods and
unable to RECALL. Curse may be used to fill equipment with evil power,
allowing (for example) weapons to do more damage to particularly holy
opponents.

The curse spell can also be casted on objects. Spell will cause the 
object to be more evil, but if protected by some other magic it may fail.

~

0 'DETECT EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'detect evil'

This spell enables the caster to detect evil characters, which will
reveal a characteristic red aura.

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>

This spell invokes the wrath of gods on an evil victim. It can be very
dangerous for casters who are not pure of heart.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!
~

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~

0 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant armor' <armor>

The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2

0 TIPS~
Here are some tips that might just save your life one day.

	1.  Type 'who pk' and 'where pk' a lot.  Keep an eye out for
	    people in your range that you don't know.

	2.  Don't hang around in crowded places.  You are just placing
	    a sign around your neck saying 'PK me'.

	3.  Keep moving.  They can't get you if you aren't there.  This
	    is also a good defense against people that summon;  they
	    summon and you leave the room.

	4.  Don't sleep in places where you are likely to be found.

	5.  Don't stay for a fight that you didn't start;  PKing is
	    a matter of preparation.  Flee and live to fight some other
	    time.

	6.  If you are affected by spells (armor, detect invis, etc) know
	    when they are about to expire and be ready to renew them.

	7.  Don't flee to obvious places.  Many people have died while
	    waiting to enter their guild.

        8.  Keep a potion/scroll/wand/staff of return handy.  You 
            never know when you might be in a pinch.
        
        9.  Keep up a good supply of food and water.  Know where you can 
            find a fountain or a food shop that is out of the way.

        10.  Keep moving.  This cannot be said enough.  If you are 
             standing around at market square, expect to get dispersed, 
             summoned, and/or die.

        11.  Think and plan ahead!

~

0 WANTED~
Syntax: WANTED <player> <Y or N>

a player as a criminal. Many Sanaria mobs do not take kindly to
criminals. Only members of the Justice cabal can flag or unflag criminals.
~

0 BLACKJACK~
syntax: blackjack <target>

Using a small weighted sack, the thief delivers a blow to the back of the 
victims head in the hopes of rendering them unconscious.  "It is not a 
killing stroke.  Thieves know what happens to thieves that killed 
people.  The Assassin's Guild came and talked briefly to them--in fact, 
all they said was 'Good-bye'." -t.p.
~

0 REQUEST~
Syntax: request <object> <mobile>

Good characters may use this command to request items in the inventory or
equipment of a good aligned mob.  See consider for more info.
Consider the player's level when making a request for another player.  The
limits were put on request for a reason.  An unproven player does not deserve
Diana's armor.  You are merely removing the mob's ability to defend itself
against evil doers.  There is a 3 minute (real time) wait for requesting.
~

0 STRANGLE~
Syntax: strangle <victim>

Using their natural stealth and cunning, the assassin is able to sneak up on
opponents and render them unconscious.  Success causes them to be put to

0 ENTANGLE~
Syntax: cast 'entangle' <mobile>
 
This spell causes the thorny plants around a mob's or player's feet to reach
up and grab them, causing some damage and loss of dexterity.  This is an
offensive spell which can only be used in locations where you can also camo.
~

0 PHILOSOPHY~
Here is a general philosophy of each of the known cabal.

Justice:  The enforcement of the laws above all.  The world exists in two
	  halves: right and wrong.  The law comes first in all respects.
	  They control and decide what is lawful or not.  Their word is law.

BattleRager:  BattleRagers live for combat, and look down on those who need    
	      magic to survive.  They have a strong aversion to mage magic,
	      and are very wary of clerical magic.

Entropy:  Entropy wants to spread chaos throughout the land.  Not necessarily
	  evil, just against the ordered society.  They feel that laws and
	  rules hamper freedom, and will go out of their way to see them
	  broken, or to cause chaos.

Knight:   Honor is valued above all else.  These fighting warriors seek to
	  right injustices and correct wrongs.  They follow the ideals of
	  the paladin. 

Masters:  Discipline brings power.  This is the motto of the Masters of    
	  Magic.  The advancement of the Art is their motivation.  They     
	  look down on physical combat, preferring to use their magic.

Shadow:   Shadow is a web of intrigue.  Establishment of its power over all    
	  is its goal.  Shadow, in short, wants to control the world, but 
	  would never do so openly.
						 
Keep in mind these are only general guidelines.

one in need of a favor. When you successfully fulfill your job, you will 
receive a certain number of favor points.

These points will be awarded in greater amounts by excellent roleplay

The JOB command is used for information about your current job, to
request a job, etc. Commands are as follows:

JOB POINTS - Gives your current number of favor points. Used anywhere.
JOB INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you of a few things
JOB TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or the
           amount of time until you can request another job. This command
           may be used anywhere.

JOB REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in which you
must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a creature, when you
come across that creature you will see a [TARGET] notice before it. This is
the creature you are to kill.

JOB COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item or
killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster who sent you on
the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed your quest,
he will reward you with gold and quest points. Once you complete a quest you
cannot request another for 10 minutes.

JOB LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the questmaster.
These items are not buyable via gold, they must be purchased with quest points.

JOB BUY <item> - Purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the cost
of the item from your quest points.

0 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

0 STATS STRENGTH INTELLIGENCE DEXTERITY WISDOM CONSTITUTION~
Strength    : A combat stat. Effects to a small degree how often you hit, how
              hard you hit, how heavy of weapon(s) you may wield, and how much
              gear you may carry.
Intelligence: Affects how much mana per level you gain, how effectively you
              practice, how much mana you regenerate per tick, and to a certain
              extent, how quickly you learn your skills/spells with each use.
Wisdom      : Determines how many practices you gain per level.
Dexterity   : Affects how many items you may carry, how hard you are to hit to
              a certain degree, and your dodging potential.
Constitution: Affects your health, and how quickly you regenerate it. Read
              'help death' for more on constitution.

See also STATS2 for more on stats.
~

0 STATS2~
Below level 20, your stats are only given in vague terms. When you gain a level,
stat affecting equipment does not affect you as much as it would for everyday
use. You will need to learn how much it does through experimentation. We keep
this somewhat unknown because we would like for you to concentrate more on
roleplaying then min/maxxing your stats all the time.

Stat powers are judged on the following scale, from strongest to weakest:

   Strength      Intelligence    Wisdom       Dexterity    Constitution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Titanic       Genious         Profound     Expert       Vigorous
   Remarkable    Brilliant       Insightful   Adroit       Robust
   Strong        Astute          Sensible     Quick        Healthy
   Average       Average         Average      Average      Average
   Weak          Slow            Dim          Clumsy       Weak
   Infantile     Incompetant     Foolish      Hopeless     Sickly

You _cannot_ reach your maximum potential through magical items on a stat.
In order to get the maximum benefit of your full wisdom, for instance, it
must be at it's natural limit. For example, if your max wisdom is 18, and
you have only trained it to 17, it does not matter how many +wisdom items
you wear, it will not be counted above 17 for levelling purposes.
~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~

84 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~

0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~

2 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~

0 GATE~
Syntax: cast 'gate' <target>

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set. Players may 
only be immune to others' summon, if they are not in their PK.
~

0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  Nearly all classes may learn shield block, but only 
warriors and clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield 
blocking attempts, and whips have an easier time getting around them.  
Axes may split shields in two.
~

0 BASH~
Syntax: bash <victim>

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent, so bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~

0 BERSERK~
Syntax: berserk

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

0 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Syntax: dirt <victim>

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.
~

0 DISARM~
Syntax: disarm

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~

0 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.
~

0 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

0 ENVENOM~
Syntax: envenom <dagger>

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

0 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~

0 KICK~
Syntax: kick <victim>

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

0 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type. Due to
their belief that touching the blades of their opponent with their own
blade is a loss of honor, Assassins cannot parry with swords.
~

0 RESCUE~
Syntax: rescue <friend>

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

0 TRIP~
Syntax:  trip <target>
 
The ones who mainly engage in battle by using physical contact
are able to use their might to forcefully trip someone.  Yet, if they
try and trip someone who may overpower them or are superior to
them in strength they may find out that it is extremely difficult to 
successfully do.
~

0 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

0 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

0 LORE~
Syntax: lore <object>

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses. All classes may learn lore, although 
thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard to use.  The 
harder you practice lore, the more information you will find.
 
CURRENTLY:  Lore is not necessary to practice, as it is just as efficient at
1%, as it would be at 100%.  This is subject to change, but you will be first
notified on Board 1 (Announcements) before anything is done to it.
~

0 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

0 PEEK~
Syntax:  peek <target>
 
Those who are stealthy are able to use thier sly abilities to
peek and see what someone is carrying.  Very few travellers
are able to do so.  Though the more intelligent of people are
the ones who make it harder to peek.
~

0 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Syntax: pick <direction>
Syntax: pick <container>

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Very few 
classes, may learn to pick locks, and thives are the master of it.
~

0 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: steal <gold|silver> <victim>
Syntax: steal <object> <victim>

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully.
~

0 'DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~

0 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~

0 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

0 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

0 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

0 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

0 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~

0 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.
~

0 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

0 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

0 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

0 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

0 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, and generally leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

0 'CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax: cast 'create rose' (color) (message on tag)
 
This spell creates a rose of the specified color, with a tag
bearing the designated message. Available colors of roses are:
 
Red
White
Black
Pink
Yellow
(There may be more. Experiment :) )
~

0 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast "protection evil"
        cast "protection good"

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~

0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

0 MASS HEALING~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

0 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caser
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~

0 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

0 STORY~
Chapter One: The Apocalypse
 
     Thera, the land of our birth, the aira that we breathe, the food,
water, all friends and things you know, are but remnants of a 
world long dead.  You are the children this world's fate depends 
on. You are the sole survivors of a once rich world, where 
technology and magic were meshed together in unity.  You are 
the children of a new dawn. I write this short history for all to 
know, learn and understand. Do not let this knowledge slip away 
from your hands less you repeat the same mistakes (as many 
have already done) that your ancestors did. After you have read 
this document, I pray you will see the world with a new vision, 
as a child wakes up to a new reality each day. All the things you 
thought you knew were passed on by generations of ignorance 
let me deliver your soul with some badly needed answers. I 
sometimes think that as I grow older (as we all do...) we are 
nothing more than misinformed children, running free in a 
garden of death. We are born with many questions, and so little 
answers, let me shed some light on your past ... at least for a little 
while...
 
     I shall try to explain first the nature of magic, as you know it today,
and in the past. I shall then continue with a close look at what 
technology did to us, and will explain the nature of our planet disaster. 
Magic, as we call it today, is a part of everything we do in our time ... 
and we use rituals, prayers, articles and many more to accomplish our 
magic might.  In the olds days, mages, or any spellcaster for that matter, 
did not exit, their names were "psychics" or "mystics", and they drew 
their powers from their minds and souls. They were masters of the 
body and mind, and could communicate as a whole network
of minds. They could go without substance for days on end, and gather 
up their will to transform their bodies in animal essences and become 
the animals they would reflect in their minds (it is believe that druids 
still withhold the secrets of this transformation, but this is mere 
speculation). We have no other type of spellcaster alive today that are 
equal in power to the Naturalist ...  as they were called.  
 
     The only possible exception would be the guild of "Prodigy" which 
focuses mental energies with meditation, a bit like the naturalist, but 
they are eons away yet in their final evolution to the previous state of 
perfection attained by the Naturalist. We all posses magical abilities 
today, much because it is genetic, and we have evolved to this state, but 
we need specific guild lines to focus our wills, for example; the mage 
need to recite words and gestures, the alchemist needs to concoct 
potions and brews, the prodigist need his meditative trances, the cleric 
prays in fervent belief to his god (I do not mean offense ... if there are 
gods that walk the realm, I do not think any know for sure the answer, 
but it is certain that clerics derive their spell from the intensity of the 
prayers ... and their Belief in their god), the necromancer goes through 
his rituals of death and as for the rest, well. I will be glad to speak 
further of it, but in future notes. 
 
     As for the Industrialist, those who wield technology and make all 
the rest sway to its powers. Well, let me give you an example of what 
technology was at the time. Imagine taking the top 10 buildings in 
Midgaard, and place walkways from one to the other ... people could 
come and go, free of the traffic and crowds below them. Now, imagine 
making each building in your city about 200 to 300 feet high, and some 
even up to 500 feet, and making walkways and bridges each 30 feet or 
so, and imagine a road build from on end of town to the other end, with
nothing but empty air below... and imagine it going to the next city, and 
the next and the next, and beyond.
 
     Humans at the time thought big, really BIG. They were not 
satisfied with any of their environments and set off to change the very 
nature of Nature, with gene splicing. Thus, the G.E.F.N.O.S. experiment 
was born. Gefnos stands for genetically experience for new organic 
status.  Humans were not satisfied as a whole about the slow evolution 
of man, people were still dying of old age, and people wanted a cure;
for cancer. Quick, and soon. Not every one was born a mystic, and so 
people wanted results. The project goal was to successfully augment 
humans using genesplicer technology, and with it, eliminate all flaws 
from the human body. The project was at an experimental state, and 
was only used on animals and ... later, bacteria (mainly to see where 
and how we could change its genetic Nature ... even in such a primitive 
form). They built a whole complex, as big as a district, and in it were 
twelve nuclear reactors.  Its days would end with disaster... and mans 
kind with it.
 
     Naturalist believes that technology is to be used by humans, yes, 
this they agreed. But they completely disagree with the notion that 
technology should be used to alter the human state, body, and soul ... it 
was an insult to their face. They, at first, objected to the experiment, 
and soon protested openly against it, rallying thousands to their 
demonstrations. The industrialized government would hear none of it ... 
they wanted Supreme Being for their own.
 
Note: Story is under renovations, please remain patient. This story will be drastically
altered by the end.
~

0 amnesia~
Syntax: cast "amnesia" (victim)
 
 
A highly experienced mage or maligner can make you forget
not only your trouble but also some what what you have learned.
They can turn a master swordsmen into a student. Drops in skill
or skills are by 10% and the skill or spell % affected is randomly
picked by the spell itself. Somethings it doesn't even affect a
person.
~

0 insanity~
Syntax: commune "insanity" (victim)
 
     An experienced inquisitor has the ability to make people as
crazy as they are. This spell makes the victim attack anyone or anything
that comes into the same room. 
~

0 mysterious dream~
Syntax: sing mysterious dream
 
 
     Bards has the ability to sing a song so dreamy that it leaves an
impression on the entire room. This spell puts anyone that enters the
room to sleep. Anyone that stays in the room and was not put to sleep
before will be continually affected by this spell. The only spell that
can cancel this spell is the cleric's SANCTIFY LAND.
~

0 'SULFURUS SPRAY' 'ACETUM PRIMUS' 'CAUSTIC FONT' 'ACID ARROW' 'ACID BLAST' 'ACID BREATH'~
Syntax: cast 'sulfurus spray' <victim>
Syntax: cast 'acetum primus'  <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cauctic font'   <victim>
Syntax: cast 'acid arrow'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'acid blast'    <victim>
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'  <victim>
 
     These are the acid-damage based attack spells of this world.
The degrees of damage from weakest to strongest is from top to
bottom. SULFURUS SPRAY is the weakest and ACID BLAST is strongest.
ACID BREATH is the draconian based acid attack that is slightly 
stronger then acid blast.
~

0 detect hidden~
This ability lets the character see items and characters
that are hidden.

Chapter Two : A new dawn for humans , and their new mutants genes.
 
        After many years of sorrow , and the deaths of many more thousands,
earth's civilization dragged itself back from the brink of death. Small
pockets of human life survived the disasders , and were spared. This was
the fortunate case of Midgaard , one of the first cities to be build within
the new age , and it stands still. Midgaard is build near an ocean , and
was far from any major cities , they survived the cataclysm because of
dense forest and the surrounding mountains. I cannot tell you much from the
rest of the world , I have not been to other shores , but I do know about
life here, in the surrounding of the city of Midgaard , and I shall reveal
all you should know of your local history ...
 
        Over time , we build many more cities, Thalos , and later after it's
destruction , New Thalos , Val Talorn , and a few minor villages here and
there. Many mutants live in our cities , and we consider them as equals in
our society , none are considered weaker or stronger , merely different .
But this has not always been the case , and some still carry prejudice and
racial hate deep within their soul , but they hide it well , as many people
count mutants as there best friends. The history of how mutants became
accepted is a long and bloody one , and the past reveals more our ignorance
than their flaws. I speak for the true humans left , and we not many at the
time . We feared mutants , and their powers , and hunted them down and
slayed all the children when we could . None would survive our wrath . At
the time , these were but roaming bands , they had no real community and
stayed no place very long ( sounds familiar? yes , the kingdom of Hordes is
much like that now , they are is left of the primitive way of life of
mutants , the die hards of that age old time ). At one point , we have
heard of a mutant town , of approximatly 500 mutants. This scarred us deep
within our souls and we needed to take action . We decided to send a spy
into the town , to gather information , and slay the leaders if he could .
( I must part here and try to explain a simple fact , magic , as I have
said , is still very stong among us , the only difference is the way we use
our naturalist heritage      and it is said that the immortals , those
being of immense powers , are still among us still ... they would be was is
left of the old naturalist line ... but this is no more than speculation ,
I shall go on ) . We made a disguise for the spy , and cast enhancing
spells to make the costume complete. The results were staggering , we were
scared of our own man ! He stole in at the breaking of the dawn , and the
stalked the village from home to home . He did come back home , but the
news of his doings was completly different that what we had hoped for. He
said ; " they are like us , the yhave children that play and cry , old men
saying stories , woman hollering about their husband drunkedness .... they
even ruffly speak the same language ! For god sake , I saw a woman weaving
a new cloak for her 2 month old child !! I could not kill them." . It was
at that time , that day , after hearing the report given by the spy , that
our hatred fell , and our fears hold no basis for existance. They were
basically the same as us , only different. Mutants are now an integral part
of our society , and we hold many as closest friend. At the time , only two
main races were known , Elves and Dwarves ... and a goblinoid type of race
, the Orcish race . They are still today the races most present , but when
the Invaders came ... Many new races of mutants were added, and they were
not as friendly as our very own elves, dwarves and orcs. You can find
descriptions of these and all other races in my book named, Mutants    and
Humans ... are they different ? or are we the ones that are the mutants (
pages 22 - 133 )( type help  race )
        Over the next 50 or so years , peace held all in its wake , and the
land
prospered to the gentle flow of time . Midgaard became a prosperous city
with about 20 000 inhabitants , and new cities were built . Thalos housed
many of the spellcasters , and Heirloom was the industrial city . Things
were looking good for the region of Midgaard . Two factions , once again ,
met in the council hall , the old rivalry between naturalist ( spellcasters
) and Industrialist ( technolicians ) was refueled , and bickering soon
followed . The atmosphere between rivals was to dense , people could kill
with but a snear . At one point , a fight broke out in the council hall ,
and a 75 year long tradition of peace was broken , the kingdom would split
a part ... were it not for the following night. As both administrations
were busying themselves with politics and trying to get the upper hand in
the whole affair , the stalkers of the night sieged both cities . The
stalkers crept within each home and killed the occupants , by the time the
alarm went off , fully half of each city was burning . It was a slaughter
beyond compare. The cities burned all throufht the night , and most ov the
next day. All that is left today are burnt clumps of wood still hanging
from windows outlets from high above the wall ...... I remember so
clearly.........

0 'chapter2b'~
Anyhow , please let me continue , for I stray from the perpose of
the writtings .  The stalkers were invisible to the naked eye , and
were not many of then at alll ( perhaps 50 in all ) and the name of
the race was : Darnoks .  They come in the night like thieves on a
ride , and take away you life as a child might pluck a flower in a
garden .  We had no hope of winning .  We had one true asset we never
imagined , the Beastmen of the city of Kulien ( now a ruin ) .  They
could sense the Darnoks , and track them down with their fine sense
of smell , and incredible eyesight .  They were considered the
surpreme hunters of Midgaard , and this honor is still with them
today , for we survived the threat because of them , but we did not
win because of them .  The Darnok were afraind of the Beasthmen and
withdrew in the forest , they would sometimes attack small farmland ,
but in other words, the threat was contained , but not eliminated. 
This part of the history , you all now something about .  It is
approximatly now 50 years agon , that a man named Valiss Starhelm
appeared , and with him , his Valiss knights .  There are many
rumours of Valiss's origin , but I for one , know of it's true nature
.  Valiss was born in the mountains ,north of the city we call Val
Talorn today .  His life was a charmed one .  He never ever got hurt
, would never cry , and was of an extreme kindness and generousity . 
He was raised in a little shrine that dedicated it's faith to the god
of Truth and Justice.  He was trained early in the arts of
swordmanship , and healing ...  For he was a paladin.  Later , when
his training was complete , he became a Paladin of Truth , and no
less than 2 months later , he set forth to battle the Darnoks.  He
and his fellow knights of Valiss entered the woods surrounding
Midgaard to do battle.  ( there are only two paladins known in
history , Valiss , the first ...  Carrying the brand of truth , and
Gemma , the second , carrying the brand of Justice , the knights that
followed these men were either paladins or warriors that believed in
Truth and Justice ) .  Valiss had received form his god the brand of
truth , and with it , he gained certain abilities ( whether this is
true or not , I cannot say , but he did have a knack to know what was
true or false ...)  .  He first came upon the Darnoks in a small
valley , half hidden in the shades .  And before his eyes , he saw
the truth .  The beast were not evil , they were slaves , and the
collar around the necks of these beast was what made them slaves . 
The Darnok surrounded the knights and made a charging attack Valiss
aimed each blow to the neck , severing the head of some , and
snapping the collars of others .  The effect was instantanious .  The
liberated darnok look upon Valiss with sadden eyes , as if saying
they were sorry .  Many more fights raged , and more and more Darnoks
were liberated form their bonds , these prisonners were ever in dept
to Valiss for their freedom.  At the end , more than 35 Darnoks were
liberated , but it seemed hundreds more were still to come .  Valiss
made a deal with the prisoners , he told them to go back to their
masters ( a race we seldom speak about , the evil illithid , not much
is known about them except that they are evil slavers , and i am not
sure they are from Thera ...  But once again , I speculate.)  And
liberate as many Darnoks as possible .  It was done , the details of
the undertaking is a whole new story in itself , but it suffices to
say that they had suceeded in accomplishing their mission ...  The
Darnoks were free of the tyranny of their evil masters .  Valiss
invited them to stay in the forest where he met them first , and
build a small village for them .  Soon after , New Thalos was built a
few miles from the ruins of Thalos , and the people dedicated a whole
village to Valiss , making Val Talorn , what it is today .

0 'SIRIUS'~
The kingdom of Sirius believes that laws should govern the city of
midgaard , and they created the book of law , which Jasig Judis still
holds.  With the approach of chaos , the Siriusians wrote a series of
rules that were never to be broken , inside the city walls .  Those
rules are still with us today .  Sirius and Asper , they were the
rivals in the council chamber of thalos and heirloom , they were the
ones that almost cost the old kingdom its life , and freedom , to the
illithid during the Darnok wars.  After the war they became friends,
then they became allies.  The kingdom of Sirius calls on the help of
it's friends in the time of need.  They often group together in the
time of great battles, although, unless either kingdom is in need
they mainly keep to themselves.  It is, however, one of the
Siriusians duties to help Asper in a time of war if it is at all
possible.  This bond is helpful to both kingdoms.  The Siriusians,
with their powerful and nobel fighting skills are always in need of
the great magic that is naturally a part of the kingdom of Asper. 
There is a story that i have become familiar whit over the years in
dealing with the kingdoms from a bystandards standpoint.  It is a
story of an alliance that was formed by the kingdoms of Sirius and
Asper.  The kingdom of Sirius was selected to drive a group of
dragons from the land just north of Thalos.  The dragons were
threatening adventurers, and were rumored to be headed into the city.
The kingdom of Sirius called on it's friends from the kingdom of
Asper for help.  They needed magical assistance that only this
kingdom could offer.  The battle began.  The dragons looked as if
they would prevail.  When the group was all left for dead, however,
something happened and the entire group somehow made it safetly back
to their home city.  Siriusians questioned the outcome of the battle,
and never got an answer.  They came to believe that since they formed
an alliance with the kingdom of Asper, that they were somehow watched
over by a higher power.  This event has made their friendship with
the Asperians even stronger than what it was previously.  Siriusians
live for their laws and for their king.  They are a nobel group of
elite fighters.  Their special items, and some of their fighting
skills are kept secret, and will never be revieled to the outside
world.  That is one of the reasons that during the batle with the
dragons, they suffered as badly as they did.  They would rather have
died than unleash their secretive full potential in front of their
allies the Asperians.

0 'ASPER'~
Asper , the Magic kingdom as some call it today , they undertook
to build a new city named , New Thalos , and design it in such a way
that merchants could come and sell their wares and any time of the
day and night , creating a bustling city of trade , all were welcome
, to trade , not fight , and up to today , New Thalos is neutral in
its dealings with any conflict , the only exception is Crescent.  It
is rumoured that Asper has alchemist that can change leaf to gold
....  I laugh at this , it is nonsense .  But the other rumour that
they havee created a invisible tower well , perhaps that is true ... 
( I must stop this speculation ) .  Sirius and Asper , they were the
rivals in the council chamber of thalos and heirloom , they were the
ones that almost cost the old kingdom its life , and freedom , to the
illithid during the Darnok wars.  After the war , they became friends
, and then allies .  This bond between the kingdoms of Asper and
Sirius has become valuable to both kingdoms.  The Asperians help the
Siriusians with their great magical abilities.  As fo the benifits to
them, they are able to call upon the Siriusians for assistance in
what they lack most, nobel brute fighting force.  It is rumored that
the kingdoms unite in hard times.  The kingdom of Asper, however, is
very secretive with it's powers.  They never cast their spells to
their full ability when united with others.  There is a story that
has been passed down through generations.  The kingdom of Sirius was
in need of the assistance of asper for thier magical capabilities. 
The need for the alliance came from a battle against a group of
invading dragons outside the city of Thalos.  The two kingdoms formed
a group of its best fighters, from the kingdom of Sirius, and mages,
from the kingdom of Asper.  The fighting began and both kingdoms
suffered.  The dragons seemed as though they would prevail.  The last
member of Sirius was knocked unconcious and the last standing member
of Asper, then, cast a great spell.  The dragons were all teleported
to a far off land somewhere south of the Lankford ruins where they
would do no more harm.  And the entire group was teleported back to
safety.  None died.  When the members of Sirius questioned the
activities the Asperian responsible for the spell said, that he also
was left for dead and did not what had happened.  He waited until no
member of Sirius could see his full magical abilities.  This brings
me to the conclusion that the Asperians have power beyond that of what
anyone can imagine.

0 'GEMMA'~
The order of Gemma , was created in Val Talorn , when Valiss was
killed.  These Knights are the worlds crusaders of justice , truth ,
and virtue.  They seek evil and slay it in its bed .  Gemma was a
knight of Valiss and was away when the Valiss knights were attacked ,
he learn of their demise , and recruted new , young vibrant hopefull
.  Today , Gemma ( the kingdom , not the man ) still has a policy
that all members are welcome , as long as you proove you are innocent
, and let Gemma show you the light.  The kingdom of Gemma is always
ready for a fight and quick to make peace with other kingdoms,
although, if they are ever stabbed in the back by those who they
befriend, those betrayers are life-long enemys.  The power held by
the kingdom is, by far, the greatest of all the kingdoms.  This could
be for a number of reasons.  Since they are quick to make allies,
they do not keep many secrets, unlike the other kingdoms.  The power
of Gemma is known by all.  The other kingdoms have power that they do
not share with outsiders, therefore, you can only imagine what they
have in the kingdom itselfe.  This brings me to the conclusion that
they are, without a doubt, a very powerful kingdom, but to say they
are the most powerful one is only going on spectulation, as i often
do.  There is a story of a great battle including the kingdo ms of
Asper, Sirius, and Gemma.  This story has been passed through the
years from memory to memory, mind you, so some of the details may be
blemished.  Asper and Sirius had formed a group of their best to
search for a blood hungry group of dragons that were teleported
somewhere south of the Lankford Ruins.  It was said that these were
the same dragons that once threatened the city of Thalos years
before.  The group was formed, because, these dragons needed to be
killed.  It was rumored that they were plotting to take over Thalos
once and for all.  The kingdoms of Sirius and Asper united, but, they
needed the power of a third 'eye' to join them.  It seems that
strange things happen when these two kingdoms group alone, so they
asked for the help of Gemma.  Gemma was quick to comply, for a small
price, (it seems there is always a price involved with Gemma) and so
the group set path to The ruined city of Lankford.  The dragons were
no match for the powers united.  The fighters of Gemma shined and
unleashed every secret they had(if you could call it a secret).  The
other kingdoms in the group were baffeled.  They hardly had to lift a
sword or cast a spell in the battle.  They were not so much surprised
that they had won so easily, they were in fact suprised at the
willingness of the Gemma to share there power so readily without
worry of the other kingdoms stealing their technology.  The
philisophy behind Gemma is basically that they are honest, they are
powerful, and why try to hide either.

0 'TRISTAN'~
Tristan is one of the smallest kingdoms , but also , the most powerfull .
They are a mercernary kingdom , selling out the to richest who need their
swords. When things are quiet , they go off in search of new and more
powerfull tools for their Kingdom . Tristan rose from the ashes of
Heirloom , and are it's survivors. When the darnok came , these were the
men and women who wielded butter knives and cudgels against the dark
foes. After Heirlooms burning end , they took most of the still intact
material , and build a small fortress on the outskirts of the ruin . From
there , they sold out services to the neighborinf kingdoms , were it to
be a monster slaying or simply helping out with building of houses . They
grew wealthy and the fortress had more and more defenses added to it .
During that time , Tristan often did battle with the Hordes Kingdom , and
today , they are bitter enemies and rival, but they still respect the
laws that govern the land ... but outside the city wall , not many
encounters between Tristan and Hordes end up without bloodshed.
~

0 'HORDE'~
The horde of Kentari originated from the Kentari Plateaus of
eastern Thera.  Although considered barbarians by most people, they
are actually a group of highly superstitious hunters and gatherers. 
They are known to hate magic and anything resulting from magic.  They
avoid cities and civilization because that is where magic seems to be
strongest.  The horde consists of mainly warriors, thieves,
mercenaries, and any warrior-type classes that are willing to abandon
their magical skills (I.  E.  Black Knights, assassins, rangers and
paladins.)  Bards does not use real magic, but tricks of the eye and
they provide a good source of entertainment and folklore to the
population.  All other classes are shunned by the horde because of
their weak body.  The horde recruits races of moderate to great
strength.  They especially value giants, trolls, and ogres.  They
value felars, gargoyles, and human for their speed and dwarves and
dreugers for their endurance.  They detest pixies, elves, birdmen,
and the other weaker and smaller-sized races.  The horde believes
that enduring a hard life will bring strength and endurance to body
and soul.  They seem to have developed some forms of resistance to
magic because of this and are very tough warriors.  They believe that
the gods are almighty and they are living under the laws of god. 
They answer to only one set of law and that is of the gods.  The god
of power provides the strength for them to endure the hard life.  The
god of death provides them with the release of life and pain.  The
goddess of Life and goddess of creation grant them the power to grow.
Although they do acknowledge the existence of the god of magic, they
do not worship him.  The horde has quite a few seemingly strange
rituals.  One is that they believe that wearing the skin of their
fallen victims will give them power and courage in battle.  Another
would be that they will only loot the non-magical items of their
victims and will sacrifice the rest to their gods.  The origin of the
Horde was a humble and tragic one.  The horde's original ancestors
were decimated by a lone evil mage.  The chieftain at the time did
battle with him, but lost.  The evil mage's powerful fireballs
incinerated him and what is left of the chieftain is his Iron Skull. 
The skull has become the Horde's artifact and source of pride and
encouragement in the face of magic.  Their hatred for magic does not
end there.  They believe that magic and the search for magic caused
the Great Apocalypse so going back to the gods and the basics of life
is what the gods had intended.  Magic and knowledge disrupts their
belief system and they will adamantly fight them if they have to. 
The pass leaders of the Hordes usually either ignore the mages
completely and lived a peaceful life with god and nature or they
fought the mages furiously.  They rarely ever allied with magical
beings and only do so in the worst of times.

0 'CRESCENT'~
Crescent are , and will always be , the outsiders.  They , unlike
Hordes which our land have learn to deal with , are invaders of a
lost land that was once our neighboring nation .  From the words of
Crescent leaders before the one today , one message has taken a whole
new meaning : "we are not evil , merely different !!"  Crescent is
not evil , in there frame of thought ...  They just come to invade
and take over the whole region , because the think they can . 
Another way of thinking is : "Do you blame the wolf for killing the
deer?  Do not blame us for wanting the rule you !"  .  Crescent , it
is told , was a kingdom nation that was corrupt and manipulative . 
They could deal the world over for but a few coins .  It is said in
ancient scolls , that a warrior nation had once sought to take over
Midgaard , and was thrown back to the wild rivers from where they
came .  It seems that these warriors are now back , and have vengence
on there mind .  Crescent are formed of all type of men and mutants ,
one of the most impressive is the Giant folk .  Where the mutants
come from , no one knows , but they are truly scarry to behold.  They
also have winged mutants , Dragonmen I believe , a mix between Lizard
and bird and humans.  Together , they plan to take over our lands ,
unfortunatly , not by force .  It is easy to think that a kingdom can
be succesfully fought against when in war, you but a sword to a sword
, and a shield to an arrow , and so on ...  Crescent have learn from
their initial mistake , and are now more devious , and expecially
cunning .  They will first try to buy land in an area , and build
huge markets with weird items and foreign technology .  They then
would seek to buy your wares for abusing prices , and make contracts
with not so noticeable policies , one of those was the taking of your
land if you did not pay a monthy tribute for the usage of there
items.  In the Siriusian Laws , contracts are to be fully observed ,
and Crescent would be master of those laws ...  Flaws.  They would
hire thugs from Hordes and make them break the poor farmer legs , so
he could not work , and pay his tribute , and so lost his farm to
Crescent.  Crescent is corrupt , and is corrupting all those that
associate with them .  No they are not evil , merely cunning .  I
have myself quite a few Crescent technologies, and must pay a
continual 50 gold per year to use them!!  They are waiting for the
right oppurtonuty to take over , either with money, lies or simple
brute strenght.  The one thing that Crescent has that is perhaps the
most important technology we know , and that is perhaps the real
reason why we deal them instead of just ignoring them .  They hold
the ancient secret of clonning , and because of it , many of the
richest people , adventurers and kings alike , can live many thrills
and lives because of it.  The technology was sold to Sirius , Asper
and Gemma , in exchange for passage in the city , and a formal peace
offering .  They kingdoms could not say no to this .  And so ,
Crescent was accepted , althought now , with the passage of time ,
clonning was shown some flaws.  After a few tries , it was noticed
that the memories and physical abilities of the clones , and all
futur clones , were less and less exact .  With the flaws in this
unique technology surfacing the tension between kingdoms raises.  The
kingdom of Crescent is ready at all times for war with any of the
kingdoms that they have treaties with.

0 'KUJIKIRI'~
The true history of Kujikiri, before they came to Thera, is known
only to their leaders. That is a story that is passed from Shihan to
Shihan. What is known, however, is Kujikiri's history in Thera, which
began the moment their ships hit the beach...
 
     Their great ships hit Thera's beaches in the month of the Hawk, day
of the Sun. The great dark ships landed, surprising the local residents,
as the ships seemed to sneak into the harbor. The people of these ships
were dark of skin, and their clothes were strange. They said they were
called 'Kujikiri'. Yet they also made their leader distinguished in
garb. Cloaked in dark purple silks, and silver trinkets, his name
was Shihan Dainyo.
 
     Now, these were the days of Valiss, and thusly, these strangers-
from-the-sea were taken to him. Dainyo had made some efforts to learn
to speak Thera's common language, and soon after meeting Valiss, Kujikiri
began trading their odd goods and knowledge. It was not long after this
first meeting that Kujikiri settled in to Thera.
 
     However, these people of Kujikiri were albeit introverted, which
made these people seem rather mysterious to the other people of Thera,
and out of this mystery many rumors were born. Moreover, the people
of Kujikiri did things in strange ways, they spoke differently, faught
differently, their magic was completely foreign to the ways of Thereans
usually performed their magic, and more importantly, these people of
Kujikiri seemed to be masters of the night. It was this that bore the
title: The Shadows of Kujikiri. This nickname was embraced by the people
of Kujikiri, meaning something different to them than what it obviously
meant to the Thereans. These things confused the people of Thera, and
soon, many people begun to believe that Kujikiri were an evil people.
 
     Evil, however, they were not. The people of Kujikiri have a strong
sense of 'Face', their own unique brand of honor. They are deadly
loyal to their friends, and enemies are treated with either strict
ruthlessness, or mocking playfullness, depending of course on the enemy.
In addition to their love of secrecy, these qualities led people to
begin to fear Kujikiri, branding them 'Dark', and 'Evil'. This, however,
is a false image, Kujikiri is somewhat of an isolationist nation when
it comes to the affairs of other nations, more neutral in these matters
than anyone else.

1 SEDIT~
Syntax:

sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and
sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case
of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. 
E.g. X types HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.

So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you
would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

Code of honor/honour for the kingdom of Kujikiri:

    means by which to kill them.
2.) If given an order by their Shihan or one blessed with the authority
    to lead, the order is to be followed exactly and without question.
    If a ChunTzu cannot fathom a flan, it is also less likely an enemy
    will.
3.) ChunTzu are blessed with the ability to summon forth dark creatures
    from the nether realm. When finished with their services, the
    ChunTzu must send them back to their home through the route of
    death, or they may become displease, and refuse services.
4.) Those of good influence (OOC: race or class) are forbidden to pass
    beyond <rank 4>.
5.) A ChunTzu willing to die will get killed. A ChunTzu afraid to die
    will be captured.
6.) Kujikiri must function as one with the strength of many. ChunTzu
    must make an effort to become close and have no feud between them.
7.) It is the Shihan's obligation to Kujikiri that each person willing
    to join is tested prior to induction, and is sure this person is
    Kujikiri material. (Consultation with the rest of Kujikiri is
    recommended.)
 
Failure to obey this code will result in various degrees of punishment
depending on the Shihan's desire.

      a character.

      - The only exception to this if you're looting in order to return the
         character's eq, and this may only be done if the character died
         from a non-PK related death.
- Killing a character's charmie/pets when the character is outside of your

~

0 religion~
For the time being, there will be no formal, coded religion
system for Fate of Kingdoms.  There are hopes and plans to implement
one at some point in the future.
 
RP Guide: Roleplaying religion is, however, strongly encouraged - particulary
for clerics.  A good roleplay model should be based on the assumed
"facts" of life on Thera.  We will asume a pervasive religious system
which honors Takeda as a nearly all powerful god who conquered wild
elemental forces early in the Age.
    Takeda's goals are often clouded, but those of his servants,
the other main gods, are not.  Their charateristics are widely
known and they interact with mortals on a fairly frequent basis.
Those that worship these gods are seen as devote on Thera.
    It should be noted that many of the devote still distrust or
hate the druids.  Many years ago, a group of druids tried to release
a powerful elemental spirit and destroy the gods.  They were stopped,
but only after great bloodshead and sorrow.  Non-druids who worship
gods other than these, are considered to be lunatics.
 
For more information on what the god each administrator roleplays
stands for, enter help [Admin's name]

Syntax: cast 'water elemental'
Syntax: cast 'air elemental'
Syntax: cast 'fire elemental'

  Elementals are creatures that can be summoned by
powerful druids.  The elementals are shown based on
their power, water being the weakest and earth being
the strongest.  Regardless to the level of a druid,
they have only enough power to control one elemental
at a time.

rescue, however, guard gives a possibility for guarding
the other player per round instead of all the time.  One
only needs to input the command once, and until it is
entered again, you will always attempt to guard the
other player

0 blind blindness~

This spell is a particularly nasty spell.  It renders the victim unable
to see anything in the world around them, unless of course they can
manage to stumble their way to a healer somewhere to get it cured.
You can, however, still see potions while it is on so if you have
a potion of cure blindness in your inventory, you're in luck!
~

0 blindness dust~
Syntax : blindness dust
 
This assassin skill works very similar to the spell blindness.  However.
since it is a dust, and not mystical in nature, it cannot be cured by
a cleric.  It is an area attack spell, so be careful about using it.
That means, by the way, that it affects everyone in the same room as you
when you use it...
~

0 poison dust~
Syntax : poison smoke

used and disappears.  The check for wether you are succesful at
reciting it or not is based primarily on your % in the skill.  If you
do not have the scrolls skill, you cannot recite scrolls.  
~

0 wands~

The wands skill is used to make use of a magical wand.  A wand is
a special magical device that stores spells.  It can only discharge
the spell a certain number of times.  Once a wand is used up, it

 Only a select few can use the magical power stored in a staff. 
However, for those who have the knowlege, it is fairly easy to make
use of this potientially deadly power.  In order to use a stave, you
must first be holding it in your hands.  You then must brandish it. 
But be careful, if you fail on your attempt to properly use it, the
stave could very well explode in your hands.  The success rate is
influenced in big part by your % in the staves skill.

82 builder2~
The quick and easy guide to building.
General note: when editing descriptions and using the . command
(like .f) you need to have parsing turned off on programs such as zmud, this can be 
done by clicking on the little computer screen n the corner and placing the cross on it 
(this also disables stringing commands together using the ; )
 
Before you start, make sure you have a rough map of the shape, the number of rooms 
and where the doors are going to be in your area, otherwise you will get into all sorts 
of trouble.
 
Type asave area A LOT, otherwise your area will eventually become corrupted t some 
point, and ALWAYS type it before you log out.
 
In general for your first area think small, no more then 30 rooms, otherwise it will 
never get finished.
 
REDIT
 
Step 1, ignore and don't think about mprogs for your first area.
 
Step 2, remember you area name, if you forgot use alist to list all areas.
 
Step 3, creating rooms: Use redit <vnum> to edit a room (this also transfers you 
directly into that room). Or use redit create <vnum> to add a new room.
Typing command gives you a list of all the commands now available to you in redit. 
Typing show shows all the room details in redit.
 
Step 4, start typing: typing desc allows you to edit the room's description (typing 
description edits your own description not the rooms). Your descriptions need to be at 
least 4 lines long, and don't mention names of the mobs you will create (as they could 
be killed and then the description looks odd), physical objects that will be in the room 
that are takeable (again if there taken it looks odd). A little colour can make the room 
a bit more alive, but try to avoid too much. Use help colour for a list of available 
colours (it is also necessary to terminate all colours at the end of the colour section 
with {x.
 
Step 5, exits, use help exit for more information. To add an exit, you need to still be in 
redit, use either dig which creates the new room as well as linking it, or link. 
Type <direction> dig <vnum>  
i.e. north dig 17755 which links and creates the room.
Always add descriptions to doorways, and its useful in corridors to, the description 
can be seen by the player then they type: look north. To add the description you need 
to be in redit in the correct room and type:
 <dir> desc
to set a door use 
<dir> door
 
Step 6: room flags: These are rarely used, but provide useful rooms like no_magic 
rooms, but use them with care and don't ad many if any to your area.
 
Other Redit commands:
Owner: don't use this.
Create: creates a new room
?: gives help
sector: Not used much, not really needed for indoor areas (remember many ranger 
skills can only be used in forest and jungle sectors though)
format: formats the room description (you can also use .f from inside the desc)
rcopy: copies the majority of the information from one of your other rooms, useful for 
corridor sections, or large plains.
Mreset, oreset: try not to use these, you need to learn the external reset command 
(used outside redit)
Oshow, mshow useful commands to look at all objs/mobs in the area.
 
MEDIT:
Step 1, set the level of the mob, and then use autoset to standardise its stats.
 
Step 2, set the names to attack/look at the mob, i.e. 
name guard sanaria gate, this would allow you to look at it if you type look guard, 
look sanaria, look gate.
 
Step 3, set the race, use ? race for more information on what races are available, this 
sets the standard immunities, resistances and vulnerabilities.
 
Step 4, set sex, align, wealth and size. Align is between 1000 and 1000 for chaotic 
evil to lawful good. Size is important for certain skills against the mob such as shield 
bash, which tends to be size and weight orientated. Wealth is in silver (approx 100 
silver in 1 gold).
 
Step 5, set offensive behaviours: use ? off for a full list of offensive behaviours. Most 
common ones to use are dodge, parry, bash kick trip and dirt kick, depending on what 
you want your mob todo. Use fast to make the mob attack more.  Avoid using  assist_ 
Too much as it tends to cause problems when there are a lot of mobs in the room 
(problems being player deaths)
 
Step 6, set affects: use ? aff for a list of most of the affects (some haven't been added 
yet including detect_invis, detect_hidden, detect_steal and some others but they can 
still be used) common usage ones include sanc, protection evil, fly, invis, fade 
(hidden), camo, haste and pass_door. Be careful about using spells such as slow on 
the mob as this means the players cannot then cast that spell on the mob.
 
Step 7: set dam type: use ? weapon for a list of possible weapon types to use, not all 
of these will work so you may have to try a few.
 
Step 8, set short and long descriptions: short description are for when a player uses 
scan <direction> or the mob is fighting. Long descriptions are what's seen when the 
player looks in the room.
 
Step 9, description: use desc again to edit the mobs description, a minimum of 2 lines 
is required give a general description of its size, race, perhaps its claws or its 
weapons, but try to avoid things like it strikes fear into your heart unless it's a really 
really nasty mob.
 
SEE help BUILDER3
~

82 builder3~
MEDIT Other information:
Use ? act for useful things such as act sentinel stops a mob leaving its room, 
aggressive makes the mob attack all players of lower level. Use wimpy with care on 
high level mobs as it makes the mob run at 25% health, which could be an awful lot 
of chasing.
Also use act for changer (banker), shopkeepers, and healer.
 
Be careful creating hard mobs with specific weapons/damage as players can charm 
mobs that are immune to some weapons dam type (druids for instance get 4 
elementals at high level, fire elementals is immune to fire, earth is immune to lighting 
etc.)
 
OEDIT
 
Step 1: set type, use ? type for the different types, set the level and then autoarmor for 
the armor, and autoweapon for weapons.
Step 2: set name, set the names to get/ use/wear items (do not use colour here).
Step 3: Set class/race (if applicable) this sets what classes and races can wear the 
items. Use class all and race all to set all
Step 4: Set wear, you must type wear take for a person to be able to get an item from 
the ground (don't set this for things such as furniture etc. usually only 1 wear position 
is used in addition to this.
Step 5: set whether the item is to be limited. Keys are usually limited to one, so only 
one can load on the mob (keys also automatically rot after 2 ticks)
Step 6: ? extra gives the list of all extras available, use extra hum, for an item to be 
seen while blind, and extra glow for items to be seen in the dark.
Step 7:  use addaffect  to add hp/mana/hit/dam affects. As a genral guide, do not set 
hit n dam above level/10 - 1 i.e. a level 80 helm should not have more then 7/7 
hit/dam. For hp/mana it shouldn't be above level - 20, ie. Level 80 helm should not 
have more then either 60hp, or 60 mana.
Step 8: addapply does not currently work.
Step 9: add descriptions, short is what the player sees when the item is worn, long is 
what the player sees when the item is on the ground.
 
 
General notes: some people like to build the whole level first, then add mobs and 
objects, I usually build my corridor, add rooms off it, add mobs then add keys, but its 
upto you what you do, I do advise you don't lock doors until you've created the key 
for them otherwise it will get frustrating.

0 shaman~
Shamen are a group of magic-users who pull from the
natural forces of the flora and fauna around them.
They do not cast, sing, or commune their spells.  Rather,
their magic comes from a series of intricate traditional
dances and movements.  They are reverent toward all life,
and either actively or passively seek to protect it.
 
As a druid can summon the elements, so too can the shaman
bring forth nature's allies to his aid.  The shaman also
posesses the ability to breathe tremendous magical forces,
much like those of a dragon.

ARTHUR
You ask around the town about the one called Arthur and they tell you many
interesting things. He was born in the far off town of Milici and lived
the life of a peasant farmer up until his parents were killed. The
townspeople say a band of orcs sacked his farm and killed his parents.
He escaped the carnage and started a new life in Midgaard studying the
clerical magics. He is a rather well mannered man, but the guards have
said that they often see him leaving the city late in the night, armed
with his mace and a spellbook. They say he comes back in the early morning
hours with scratches and bruises matching his blood covered mace.

0 riannon~
My Father, Larnth was a high rank demon worshipper for the former
mighty Kingdom of Narssius.  He spent many years worshipping Zelphax
and informing other of his being.  Because of great devotion to his
kingdom he was a huge part of the war that came upon.  The war
between Gondor and Narssius.  Because of Larnth's great involvement
in the war and the dangerous environment that Larnth's wife was in
she fled out of reach from the war.  Anthra, my mother, ended up at a
sea shore hungry, cold, and confused.  Lonely night after lonely
night passed by while she sat on the shore crying, when a slightly
familiar face appeared and began to comfort her.  She couldn't
remember where or how she knew this person, maybe it was all in
imagination.  Xarnix restored her faith in life and nursed her back
to health.  They spent many nights together inside his cave near the
sea shore until he talked her into returning back to Thera to stand
proud beside her husband's side.  She found herself, yet again, alone
when she reached the town of Sanaria.  Larnth had been killed in the
war.  Anthra searched all over for the person responsible for the
death of her husband, but was not successful.  Having no idea what to
do or how she was going to survive.  Anthra became numb.  She sat in
her cottage, that was right outside the town of Sanaria, day in and
day out for a long while, completely saddened.  During the long time
that she spent locked up inside her cottage she gave birth to me. 
Still in the state of depression Anthra didn't take very good care of
me.  I laid on the dirt floor of our cottage for the eight days
straight, after my birth.  She was only acknowledging my presence
when I was hungry.  I was told that a man was passing by the cabin
and heard the desperate cries of an infant, so he entered the cabin. 
When he entered he found me cold, hungry, and on my last breathe.  He
seized me from the horrible place, taking me from my mother.  That is
all that has been told to me of my past.  What I can remember of my
childhood is sitting next to a large tree watching the grass blow in
the wind and sometimes going into New Thalos to talk to the
townspeople.  At the end of the day I would return to a small one
room shack in the woods.  This shack had only a cot and a table with
one chair.  Each night when I'd return from my days journey I'd find
a hot plate of food.  Each morning when I awoke I'd find a hot plate
of food.  I always assumed that it was this, that rescued me from my
mother, giving me this food.  But I was never sure, for I never seen
him or her or whatever it was that was feeding me.  When I out grew
my belongings I'd find more on my cot when I returned at the end of
the day.  I found this very odd but I was thankful for whoever it was
that was feeding me.  I stayed in that one room shack till I felt as
if I were ready to go out on my own.  On my own I realized that I was
unwanted/unaccepted by the townspeople.  They taunted and teased me
to no end.  A feeling of total rejection I couldn't take it.  I
couldn't bare another moment of the abuse.  So I left.  During my
many travels alone I came across numerous amounts of different
people.  Having no food, no possessions, and no water I began to
steal to survive.  I found that looting solved all my problems.  Life
for me continued this way until the day I came across a man named
Conrad who showed me the error of my ways.  He put hope in my heart
and order in my life.  Setteling in Sanaria I began to make friends. 
I never forgot what I had been through.  Also I always asked new
people that I met if that had known or heard stories of my parents. 
The only thing that I was told by more than one person, which I
assume to be true, was that he died on the day of the sun.  Because I
had spent so much time gone from here most that were around during
the time of the Gondor Narssius war were now passed.  Even the
kingdom Narssius is now gone.  One day sitting at the Center Square
in Sanaria thinking back on my childhood a pair of feet stood infront
of me and dropped something at my feet.  I turned to ask his name but
he was already gone.  When I looked back at my feet I seen a book. 
As I picked it up I realized it was a journal.  The front of the
journal had the Narssiuss Symbol on it and it had written on ink at
the bottom skip every other one, but don't start with the first -
start at the second.  Extremely nervous to find out what was inside I
opened it.  To my disappointment the journal was in bad shape.  Every
page of the journal had a burn over certain sentences, words, or
phrases.  I've tried to figure out what the missing words on the
pages wrote, but I've been unsuccessful.  The only thing I know is
that this is my fathers journal and it could possible lead to who
killed him.  The last journal entry is marked the day of the sun,
which is the day that people have told me my father died.

0 KINGDOM_COMMANDS~
Kingdom commands have rank restrictions.  Which means, you must
be a certain rank, within the Kingdom, to be able to have certain
Kingdom commands.
 
<Kingdom Desecrate:  Used to destory another Kingdoms symbol.  Which
      causes that Kingdom to lose control of that area.  To use this command
      you must be in the room where the symbol is, have the entire area rid 
      of the other Kingdoms guardians and all players.  Sucessfully 
      desecrating an area doesn't give your Kingdom control of that area.
 
<Kingdom Consecrate:  Used to gain control of an area.  Which you then
      recieve profit/taxes from that area, that go directly to your Kingdom
      account.  To use this command you must have area entirely rid of mobs.
 
<Kingdom Guardian:  Used to defend your area.  There is a limit on how
      many guards you are to have in an area.  Also a limit on how many 
      many guards you have in a specific spot in one area.  Guardians are
      permanent they last through reboots and crashes.  They stand their 
      ground until killed by the enemy.

0 ELF~
{RGeneral:{BElves mingle freely in humans lands, always welcome yet 
never at home there. They are well known for their poetry, dance, 
song, lore, and magical arts. Elves favour thing of natural and simple 
beauty. When danger threatens their woodland homes, however, elves 
reveal a more martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow and 
battle strategy.
 
{RPersonality:{BGenerally, elves are well-educated, highly moral 
creatures with a strong sense of manifest and justice. Although 
most elves still consider themselves superior to most of the sub-human 
races.
 
Elves are more often amused then excited, more likely to be curious then 
greedy.  With such long lives, they tend to keep a broad perspective 
on events, remaining aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When 
pursuing a gold, however, whether an adventurous mission or learning 
a new skill or art, they can be focused and relentless. They are slow to 
make friends and enemies and even slower to forget them. They reply 
to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
 
{RPhysical Description:{BElves are short and slim, stand about 4 to 5 
feet tall and typically weight 85 to 135 pounds, with elven men the 
same height as and only marginally heavier then the elven women. They 
are graceful but frail. Tend to be pale-skinned and dark-haired, with 
deep green eyes, Elves have no facial or body hair. They prefer simple, 
comfortable clothes, especially in pastel blues and greens, and they 
enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. Elven possess unearthly grace and 
fine features. Many humans and members of other races find them hauntingly 
beautiful. However, the average life span of and elven is many times 
longer then most races, creating myth of elven immortality. 
 
The average elf will live for 600 years and some have lived for as long 
as 1200. Elves do not sleep, as members of the other common races do, 
Instead and elf meditates in a deep trance for 4 hours a day. An Elf 
resting in this fashion gains the same benefit that a human does from 
8 hours of sleep. While meditating an elf dreams, though these dreams 
are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years 
of practice. The common word for an elf's meditation is trance as in 
"four hours of trance". 
 
{RRelations:{BElves consider humans unrefined, halflings a bit staid, gnomes 
somewhat trivial, and Dwarven not at all fun. They look on half-elf with   
some degree of pity, and they regard half-orgs with unrelenting suspicion. 
While haughty, elves are not particular the way of halflings and can be, 
and they are generally pleasant and gracious to those ho fall short of 
elven standards (with after all, consists of just about everybody who's 
not an elf). From the ancient war in legendary   age of chaos, the golden 
age, and the elven civil war, the have still have hate some hate to their 
enemies. Most hated is Dark elf or as we know the to day the Drows, 
to day elf still think they are the reason for the fall of the grate elven 
empire.
 
{RAlignment:{BElves love freedom, variety, and self-expression. They lean 
toward the gentler aspect of chaos. Generally, they value and protect others' 
freedom as well as their Owen, and they are more often good then not.
 
{RLanguage:{BElves speak a fluid language of intonations and intricate grammar. 
While Elven literature is rich and varied, it is the language's song and 
poems that are most famous. Many bards learn Elven so they can add 
Elven ballads to their repertoires. Others simply memorize Elven songs 
by sound. The Elven scripts, flowing as the spoken word, also serves 
as the script for the language of pixies.  
 
{RNames:{BWhen an elf declares herself an adult, usually some time after 
achieving her hundredth birthday, she also selects a name. Those who knew 
her as a youngster may or may not continue to call her by her "Child name," 
and she may or may not care An elf's adult mane is unique creation, 
though it may reflect the names of those she admires or the name of 
others in her family. In addition, she bears her family name. Family 
names are combinations of regular Elven words, and some travelling 
among humans translates their names into common while others use 
the Elven version.

0 DARNOK~
{RGeneral:{B:  Darnoks are far distant relatives of the human race.  Their
story is one of hardship and repression.  In the younger days of the
world, a colony of illithids captured a nation of humans for use as
slaves for manual labor.  Taken from their home and into the astral
planes, the humans not only survived, but adapted and thrived.  As
the centuries wore on, the human slaves gained more knowledge of
the planes and learned from their masters.  Eventually, they were 
powerful enough to revolt and liberate themselves.  By this time,
they had evolved into something higher than the human experience.
They had become something more.  Naming themselves "darnoks"
after a great leader of theirs, they returned to Thera in triumph.
{RPersonality:{B  Darnoks are almost always shrouded in a veil of
mystery and secrecy.  They are often privy to secrets that would
boggle the average mind.  Information, secrets and knowledge
are of paramount importance to the "astrals", as they are sometimes
called.  What exactly transpired in the astral plane so many generations
ago to create the darnoks is unknown, even to this chronicler.
Some say they were fused with the powers of creation, or even 
mingled with higher planar beings such as angels or abyssals.  If
the darnoks know, they are not talking.
{RPhysical:{B  At a distance, darnoks look like humans.  Closer
inspection will reveal subtle differences, however.  Darnok flesh
tones are almost always a healthy tan that seems to gleam with
a golden inner-glow.  Their eyes are very luminescent in colors,
and are usually any shade of blue, green or purple.  Darnok
hair colors are usually dark, but some variations of gold and
silver are not uncommon.  They stand on average as tall as
a human, sometimes taller or shorter.  Darnoks usually have
lithe, light body frames.  Darnok lifespan is unknown, and they
have the power to enter the astral plane at will.
{RRelations:{B  Darnoks relate well to elves and pixies.  Being somewhat
of an outsider race, they also look favorably upon those whom
society has outcast.  They have also been known to associate
with evil races, such as drow and duergar.  Illithids hold a special
place in their history, and darnoks are wary of their former masters
to this day.
{RAlignment:{B  Darnoks are either neutral or evil.
{RSpecial:{B  Using their astral heritage, darnoks can phase in and out
of this prime material plane of existence, making them a hard
opponent to hit.{x
~

0 ILLITHID ILLITHIDS~
{RGeneral:{B:  Illithids, or "mind flayers" as they are known,
are mysterious beings with incredible mental powers and
an understanding of the universe that would drive most
mortals insane.  They dabble in forces unknown to 
normal people, and do so with impunity.  They are the
dimensional travellers, and are rumored to have come to
Thera from dimensions with unutterable names.  As 
possible descendants from the Great Old Ones, they
are well attuned to the thought patterns of all living things.
{RPersonality:{B  Flayers are cold, logical and calculating.  They
do not often show emotion, unless it is the grim satisfaction
in utterly dominating an enemy.  They are wholly evil and
manipulative, using their keen intellect to overcome their
overall physical weakness.  They posess many great 
secrets, and would use their powers to enslave an entire
race, if need be.  
{RPhysical:{B  Illithids are bipedal humanoids with heads that
could only be described as squid-like.  Their skin is soft
and greyish, and they have tentacles that hang down in
the front of their face.  Illithid eyes are unnerving, with
pale, milky globes that seem to bore right into the mind
of an observer.  They do not often speak with physical
language, preferring instead to communicate with their
own kind via telepathy.  When an illithid speaks, it is
with an otherworldly voice.  Illithid lifespan is unknown.
{RRelations:{B  To trust a mind-flayer is to court death.  They
are often in conflict with the drow and duergar, their
traditional competitors for space in the underworld.
Darnoks also do not trust the Illithid, for they were once,
eons ago, enslaved by the flayers.  As a matter of fact,
almost any intelligent race with juicy, delicious thoughts
would do well to steer clear of an illithid.  Nevertheless,
their keen minds and telekinetic powers are valued by
those bold enough to enlist their help.
{RAlignment:{B  Illithids are always evil.
{RSpecial:{B  Mind flayers can use their powers to temporarily
paralyze a victim, much like the magic spell "ESP".{x

0 felar~
{RGeneral:{B  The felar are a secretive, feline people.  They are quick in every
sense of the word:  swift-witted with lightning reflexes.  The felar tend to be
somewhat clandestine, but make individual appearances here and there.
{RPersonality:{B  Felar are secretive, and do not often open themselves up to
strangers and outsiders.  Due to this, most other races believe felar
to be arrogant stiffnecks.  Felar do little to dispel this feeling, however.
They are ferocious fighters, and are often bound to their own sense of
personal honor.  Felar can be either highly dedicated allies or ruthless
enemies.
{RPhysical:{B  Felar are bipedal, cat-like humanoids.  They stand anywhere
from four and a half to five and a half feet tall, on average.  Their bodies
are covered with soft, rippling fur that can be any color imaginable.
Their faces are dominated by large, almond-shaped, slit-pupiled eyes
that are usually very vibrant colors of green, brown, yellow or blue.
Felar often resemble the bigger predator cats, such as lions, panthers
or tigers.
{RRelations:{B  As mentioned, felar nature can be interpreted as being
standoffish.  They do trade openly with most races, but sometimes
have bad relations with orcs, trolls and duergar.  These races are
seen as, in general, lacking honor.
{RAlignment:{B  Felar are mainly neutral, however they can also be
good and evil.
{RSpecial:{B  Felar can distract an opponent and become hidden during the
midst of combat.{x
~

0 merma~
{RGeneral:{B:  Merma are a mysterious, amphibious race that are rarely seen
in the mainlands of Thera.  Those that do surface come from vast,
highly magical underwater civilizations.  They love music, dancing and
other arts, and are an intrinsically sensual people.  They are sometimes
called "sea-elves" in the legends of the ancient mariners.
{RPersonality:{B  The merma are a good-hearted people, and they get along
well with any race that is willing to accept them.  Merma enjoy magic,
and many pursue it as a hobby.  Clerics are given high standing in the
traditional merma society.  Merma are very inquisitive, and love to
learn new things and gain new knowledge.  Merma are happiest around
water, and will not go for long without at least a dip.  Merma are
thought to have lifespans that last quite a while.  
{RPhysical:{B  Merma very much resemble humans or elves, save for a
few small but obvious details:  their skintones are usually bluish or
greenish tinted.  Merma also have tiny gills that allow for underwater
breathing.  They have pointed ears that resemble fins.  Slight traces
of webbing between their fingers allows for swimming prowess.
Merma eyes are often green, but can be any color.  Common
hair colors include green and blue, with variations in blonde and
black.
{RRelations:{B  Merma relate best with elves and humans, their ancestral
"cousins".  Merma respect the dwarves' tenacity and morality.  They
love pixies, and will trade secrets with the fey whenever they can.
Evil races tend to make merma uncomfortable.
{RAlignment:{B  Merma are good aligned.
{RSpecial:{B  The merma can survive underwater, and are natural swimmers.
They can dive underwater and stay there, and also have no need for
boats or other such clumsy craft.{x
~

0 arial~
{RGeneral:{B:  Arial are bipedal, winged people.  Having one of the
more exotic looks among Theran races, they are ofen found as outsiders 
if they choose to leave their own nations.  Arial are suited for magical
professions and those involving manual dexterity, and their light frame
and keen minds can attest to this.
{RPersonality:{B  As mentioned, arial value intelligence.  They have a special
place of reverence reserved for the elders of their communities, and
their wisdom is often consulted.  Arial are often viewed by other
Therans as being arrogant.  This is partially because of the hierarchical
aristocracy that is prevalent in arial society.  Another reason for this
is the language barrier between arial and other races.  Though many
are aloof and arrogant, arial are in general a goodly race, and they
try to get along with everyone, even if some races view this as
patronizing.
{RPhysical:{B  Arial are bird-like, like a cross between a human and a
large bird of prey.  While mostly humanlike, their arms have a
light covering of feathers, and their lithe fingers sometimes sport
short, sharp talons.  Their distinguishing feature is their large, 
gracefully powerful bird wings.  This allows them the advantage
of aerial maneuverability, and the ability to dive-bomb opponents.
Arial can have feathers of any color, as well as eyes.  Arial are
a true rarity to be seen, so it is unknown how long they live.
{RRelations:{B  The arial people's aristocratic nature is a major turnoff
to many races.  They trade well with humans and elves, and
traffic in secrets and knowledge with the pixies.  Arial have a 
general distaste for evil races.
{RAlignment:{B  Arial are aligned with the forces of good.
{RSpecial:{B  Arial can dive from the skies into an opponent, damaging
them and possibly temporarily gouging their eyes.  Or they could
miss and knock themselves stupid.{x

1 MULTI PLAYING~
Multiplaying is defined as having more than one of your characters logged
onto the MUD at the same time, and/or having your characters interact with
one another, in any way.  As some players share IP, it can sometimes be
difficult for the Admin Staff to tell if a player is multi playing, and thus
it is requested if you share an IP with a roommate, sibling, etc. that you
write a note to 'Admin' on board 3, stating you're shared IP and which
characters belong to you, and which belong to the other player, playing
from that IP.
 
The following examples are instances of Multi Playing, and can result
in punishment:
 
- Having two of your characters logged on at the same time
- Having one of your characters logged on, while another character of
      yours is still on the mud, but left linkless.
- PKing someone that your alt is currently at war with.  This means, that
      if Alt A died to Enemy A, you couldn't log onto Alt B to exact
      vengeance upon Enemy A.
- Locating enemies with an alt, or seeing if they're currently online.
      What this means, is that you cannot log off your lvl 35 mage, and
      onto your lvl 70 prodigy, to check to see if your lvl 35 mage's
      enemy is on.  This means, don't use alts to find location of someone
      you wish to PK with an alt, nor should you log on alts to check the
      who list.
- Aiding your character with an alt.  This means:
      -Do not transfer eq between alts, whether directly or indirectly.
      -Do not powerlevel your lowbies with your highbie alt.
      -Do not go linkless with one char, log on another, to save the linkless
            char from death.
      -Best way to do this, do not allow your chars to interact in ANY SHAPE
            OR FORM.
 
Punishment for breaking Multi Playing rules can result in anything from a
slap on the wrist, to a slay.  In extreme and rare circumstances, special
punishment may be used at an Admin's disgression.
~

- To prevent spies, who may transfer private kingdom information via ooc.
- To keep player's alts seperate, individual, and unique.  If a player had more
      than one character in a kingdom, their character's rp would become
      intertwined, which is not allowed on this MUD.
 
Punishment for breaking the Kingdom Alts rule could result in the removal of
both of your alts from said kingdom.
~

1 LIMITS~
The Limits rule can be desribed as a character to have no more than
seven limited items within their inventory.  That means, if you type
inventory, and have eight or more limited items, you're over the limit
(be sure to check containers within your inventory as well as containers
that you are wearing).  A player may also not have more than one of the
same limited item within their inventory.   The reasons for this rule are:
 
- Preventing characters from hoarding eq.
- To try and govern the limited items possessed by players, to keep
      their possession balanced.
- To allow everyone an opportunity at some point to possess certain
      limited items.
 
There are exceptions to this rule.  Such exceptions are:
- Players are allowed to have more than one of certain pieces of
      equipment.  This includes: neck, finger, wrist, and ornament eq.
- Players are allowed to be temporarily over the limit, such as when
      wearing leveling eq.
- If you looted a corpse of a friend or acquantance, in order to return
      their eq.
 
Punishment for breaking the Limits rule can result in punishments ranging
from an Admin asking a player to choose which items to discard, until the
player is at the max limit of seven items, to an Admin seizing all limited eq
within the player's inventory.  The severity of these punishment is very
dependable on the history of the player at hand, the mood of the Admin,
and how far over the limit the was.
~

1 CHARACTER CONTROL~
Character Control can be described as the transferring of a character
to the control of another player, or simply playing a character that is not
yours.  Examples of this rule are as listed:
 
- Logging onto your friend's character for any reason.  This includes:
      - To get your own char eq.
      - To level with your own char.
      - To help your character out of a bind.
- Giving your character to another player.
      - In very rare instances, this is acceptable, and after ownership of the
            character has been transferred, it may not be transferred back or
            played by the former owner.
 
Punishment for breaking the Character Control rule varies, and usually will,
in the worst case, result in a slay.

0 BRUTAL DAMAGE~

skill is used passively, and is cumulative, as in, it adds onto the damage
inflicted by enhanced damage.
~

0 TORSANCTUS~
In all of the ages past, in all yet to come, no single word shall
ever evoke more fear and hatred than the word Torsanctus.  The Coven
of Torsanctus is a closely-knit unit dedicated wholly to the
purveying and prolonging of the demonic influences on the innocents
of Thera.  The demons of Torsanctus arose from the ashes of the
dreams of a Greater Demon.  This demon sought to conquer, and
eventually lost his mind, casting his warriors against nations like a
wave on the shore.  And like that wave, they broke.  The Demon's
armies were shattered, and dispersed to the corners of the world.  A
great upheaval soon followed, one that destroyed all held beliefs and
nations.  These cataclysmic events forever altered the face of Thera.
Those that survived awoke to find a world unlike any they had ever
seen.  Lost along with the powerful nations of the world was the
demonic coven, and it appeared as if the dream would finally die. 
Yet two lone figures arose to carry on.  One, a grim and sombrous
dark knight, the other a boisterous and robust troll warrior.  Fate
brought these old friends together again, as they had once belonged
to the demonic kingdom of the past.  They had both recieved the words
to a strange and macabre song in their dreams, and bot worked
together figure out it's meaning.  Only then did they find that it
was a song of Summoning, the Canticle Nocturne it was called.  The
demons were eager to be unleashed upon the world again, and the
knight and warrior were only too happy to oblige them.  At the stroke
of midnight, on the longest eve of the year, the Canticle Nocture was
recited, and the demons were brought fourth anew.  This new coven, a
new brotherhood, was named Torsanctus after an ancient and mythical
>demonic utopia.  Torsanctus has been born into the world, and in
time, >Thera will weep and rue the day it was born.

0 VISION~
Syntax: cast 'vision' <target>
              dance 'vision' <target>
 
While in deep concentration and a total focused state of mind only 
a select few are able to vision another.  The select few are the Shaman, 
the Druid, and the Mage.  When successfully done the Shaman dances the
spell while pronouncing the magic words.  The Mage, waves their hands
in the air and also pronounces words.  While the Druid simply focuses and
utters some arcane words.  After they have pronounced their words they
all fall into a trance.  Which then a cloud of fog arises and that is when 
they are able to spot the location of whom they visioned.  By doing this
they are most likely to send a shiver down the spine of the one being
visioned.

it has numerous sideeffects. It will still bring players
out of afterlife if you cast it in a room with their corpse.
 
But when they are pulled out, they will have almost no health
or mana, and they will also be greatly weakened for a long
time after that, where their health, mana, hitroll, damroll
and savingthrows are ruined and they will move incredibly slow
for a few minutes.

0 nyxx~
Eons ago the illithid race massed in a dimension unknown to the
theran population. The illithids were quite aware of their weak
other-dimensional neighbours, and as the illithids evolved they
learned to master the art of travelling across the boundaries of the
two dimensions.
The far more intelligent and evolved illithids wrecked havoc on the still 
infant human civilization, and brought back thousands of slaves to their
own dimension. Over the years the slaves themselves evolved to fit their 
new harsh enviroment and thus spawned the darnok race...
 
As generations passed even the illithid community became familiar with 
lack of discipline, and slowly renegades and criminals began to surface 
amongst the illithids. Still maintaining control.
The High Emperor Khurnazphorr II ordered his most trusted advisors to 
think up an effective way to punish these unwanted subjects in a way that 
would not be an economical burden to the Empire.
The advisors did their job well...
 
A desolate dimension was located, and it was named Nyxx. The 
interdimensional pathfinders created an oneway portal leading to Nyxx. A 
prison dimension had been created.
The High Emperor was pleased with the solution, and began deporting 
unwanted elements there
Immediately. While civil unrest still lingered among the illithids, the 
darnok slaves had also begun to cause trouble. Having lost their human 
weaknesses, their mental prowess had developed until it reached a 
frightening degree. Rebellions broke out more and more often in the slave 
camps, and the Emperor found it necessary to deport the darnoks who 
were too dangerous to keep around the dimension, alongside those 
impossible to enslave or force to work.
Thus the population on Nyxx grew both in numbers and in race variety...
Having already concluded that Nyxx held no values, and hardly the natural 
resources to sustain life for a vast amount of people, The Emperor and his 
advisors saw no need to keep a watch on Nyxx. They knew the 
interdimensional portal could only be used one way, and therefore  
considered the problem solved. 
As time passed the banished illithid renegades and criminals found 
themselves forced to try and co-exist with their former darnok slaves. The 
harsh dimension they had been forced into exile within simply demanded 
cooperation if anyone was to survive. Slowly they learned to harness each 
others strengths and make up for each others weaknesses, and a new 
multiracial community was created in the prison dimension of Nyxx.
For several generations the inhabitants of Nyxx could do nothing but fight 
to survive. The struggle to harness the few natural resources available, the 
struggle against famine, the constant battle to fight off assaults from vile 
creatures and terrible storms of unbelievable strength all aided both in 
strengthening the bond between the two races, but also to empower the 
individuals over generations of evolution.
 
As time passed their community became so well established that they 
could begin to focus on other more important things, such as how to 
escape...?
The brightest minds of Nyxx no matter the race were gathered in a council 
that had the sole purpose of working on a way to escape their prison 
world. Much of the knowledge of dimensional travelling had been lost 
over time, and progress was slow for the council. 
The seats in the council were given from parent to child alongside any 
knowledge they had gained, and for countless years many generations 
worked towards the very same goal. Slowly but steadily their knowledge 
of the travelling magic was learned once more. At first only working 
within the dimension as they could not yet uphold a portal for more than 
seconds, but later their skill and power grew and they soon mastered the 
pathways known as nexus. 
Now they turned their eyes away from Nyxx, searching outwards towards 
other worlds. Only myths had survived of the known dimensions visited 
eons ago, and their search was made in blindness, as they had no clue 
where to seek a suitable dimension to seize as their new home. The vague 
recollection of a realm known as Thera still lingered in the memory of the
darnoks, as the tale had been passed down all the way from their human 
ancestors.

0 ARRUDOR~
In the beginning of the world when Thera was first formed, there
lived an ancient, powerful group of people called the Arrudor.
The reason for their power was such that they understood that
nature and magic are essentially the same thing of origin, and
there are no differences between the two. They understood that
the power of nature and the other mystical magic power cannot
exist without the other. They enjoyed wielding their power and
shaped the world as they saw fit. They lived in this utopia for
many generations.
 
Sadly, after many eons have passed, the younger generation of this
ancient race had forgotten the source of their power. They had
forgotten the importance of the co-existance between nature and
magic. The younger generations broke into two different sects, a
group of people studying in the power of nature, these people later
became druids, rangers and such. The other sect of people studied
in the magical powers, they later became wizards and prodigies.
Althought the two sects lived in harmony at first, this harmony
between them did not last for long as they disagree with each other
on many subjects. Fearing that a civil war might occur and that
the newborns will forget the true source of their powers, the elders
wrote down all their knowledges and instilled it into the tome of
magic. They sealed it such that only the God knows where it can be
found.  As the elders expected, a civil war broke out. This ancient 
race of people destroyed their own kin without mercy. In their history 
this was called "Proelium ab Natura Magus". It wiped out almost all 
of their populations, those who survived are forgotten in time. They
took form of other newborn races and forgot about their roots.
 
Sesori, without knowing it himself, was one of such desendent. The
Rogue diety Drenalus, seeing how it would be useful to have such
power to be have by himself, Drenalus called out to Sesori. Knowing
that only the desendent of the once powerful race can wield wuch
power, Drenalus hoped that the drow will listen to his every wishes
in the future, from such, Drenalus told Sesori about the ancient
tome of magic and sent Sesori on the quest to seek out the tome. Not
knowing Drenalus' true intention and curious about such ultimate
power. The young drow set out to the quest.
 
However, Drenalus' plan did not succeed. As Mahongeon, the God of
nature and magic saw through his plan and drove him away. Mahongeon,
feeling sorry for the drow, sent down his avatar and to the drow
and presented to him the tome he had been searching for. After
reading the tome his ancestor had wrote about the ancient power,
Sesori knows what must be done. He must start a kingdom and help
those of the other descendents remember their true identify. 
Together, they will bring back the old power they once had.

The Lost Children of Arrudor does not meddle much with the affair
of the others. As our main objective is to re-discovered the lost
art of our ancestors and bring our old empire to its glory. We are
neither good nor evil, in times of war we are most likely not going
to take side, but will only join when the threat is upon us or
unless some other special events occur that forces us to join the
war. In another word, we are a neutral kingdom.
 
Any race or class can join, as in the ancient time we took form of
all newborn races of Thera. We do not care much about their personal
alignments or how they deal with their personal affairs. However
the kingdom alignment is neutral, so anything that has to do with
kingdom affairs will be dealt in a neutral manner. Should anyone
disregard it, he or she will be banned.
 
In the Lost Children of Arrudor, we are all equal. Whether you are
the king or an initiate, all may participate in the decision makings
regarding kingdom affairs.

0 AZURATH~
There was once an Kingdom of holy light where the sun shined down on the
castle walls of this kingdom. The kingdom was in the lands far away from
the main cities of Thera. But peace and happiness did not last long. For
soon the lands were invaded by outlanders. The outlanders were strong in
mind and in power. The Holy Kingdom went out to fight a war that was
being fought. In front of the Army of Soldiers and Knights rode the King's
Wizards and their Clerics. The Holy Kingdom had a lot of Magical support
from the Mages and the Clerics near by. The first battle was fought.
Swords clashed between the Invaders and the Holy Defenders. But at the
end of the day no one would win. Both sides lost many man and many were
wounded. But the only difference was the Invaders would somehow repleish
their ranks by the end of the day with fresh soldiers. The Holy Defenders
were amazed and didn't know what to do. So they decided to retreat. The
Invaders took over many of the Lands within a few weeks that followed.
The Defenderes gathered around and decided on a plan. They will stand
until the last man falls. Soon the Invaders came near the kingdom castle
grounds. The battle raged on. That's when things changed. The three head
leaders of the kingdom gathered around behind their king. One of them was
Merlwrath The Head of the Mages Order. The second one was Araelith The
Head of the intelligence and assassination. And the last was Illtrave the
Head General Knight Commander. The three were friends and they gathered
together to plan something. "We need to do something Fast" Said Araelith
the Sneaky. "But what!" Replied Illtrave. "We can't go on like this my
friends..Our people are at grave danger and soon if we can't do anything
they will be gone" said Merlwrath The Divine Magi. "I say we gather our
Elite troops that's under our command and move out of this kingdom. We
should take our people to safety" Said Illtrave. "Very well" replied his
two friends. They went up to the king with the idea but the king was bold
and stupid. He took smartness for an act of coward and demanded the three
Leaders and banished the three from out of the Kingdom lands. But many of
the elite troops under the three commands followed them into the Banishment.
The three leaders left with their backs turned never to look back again.
Soon they heard word that their kingdom have been over ran and destroyed.
They grieved for their losses but decided to go on their way. Soon
Merlwrath decided starting another kingdom will be a good idea and they
settled down. For many months they built a strong hold. But what happened
was out of any reasons anyone can give. The near by kingdoms that were
allies of the Holy Defenders thought evil and bad of the three. They didn't
know that the three only left because they saw what was comeing and wanted
to save their people. So what they did was they cast them into outlaws.
They decided to hunt every last man down that followed the three. Soon
they began attacking the clan's strong hold. The three friends tried to
stop the fighting. They tried to explain what was happening. But none
would listen. So the three friends decided to attack back. Soon another war
broke out. But this time the war will change the last three Holy Defenders
of light. They changed in many ways that no one can explain. They became
everything that means anything to them. Soon as time flowed by like the
river. They decided to leave their Clan Strong hold. For there was
nothing to gain from staying here. They decided if they were to become
powerful and take the road they each have plan to take then they must
move away from these lands. For if they stay here. All may be lost. They
left the lands on the white winged ships and landed in Thera. Merlwrath,
Araelith and Illtrave decided to find their new home. They made a base
camp near the lands of Main Thera cities and the three looked for their
students who would carry out their wishes. Their only goal is to follow
the orders that will be told in the three chosen dreams. To Conquer
because they never got the chance to fully make their kingdom come true,
to reach a new limite in thier magical power, and to Over throw any
kingdoms "That stands" in their way. Useing "Magic" , "Brute Warfare",
and "Covert Assassination". Soon the chosens step foward. Merlwrath
chose an young elf mage by the name of Merlyn. Araelith choose a young
Darnok Necromancer by the name of Araenugeth. And the last one will by
decided by Illtrave the Conqueror Knight. But Illtrave and Araelith will
be different. For many things have happened to the three and where
Araelith once only rellied on stealth and intelligence he will practice
the same dark arts where Illtrave will practice. And their disciple will
follow the path of their masters.. One's goal will be to Reach new
limits in their Magical Arts. Another to spread corruption in the lands.
And the last to conquer the lands.

CODEX:
 
Azurath is a Neutral but Chaotic kingdom because they lost their basic
code of honor and such but doesn't truly believe in evil. But they are
more siding towards evil. The kingdom is Extreamely chaotic but at the
same time very well Disciplined and brave. Azurath is a kingdom with two
goals. The very first goal is the expand their reach and knownledge in
Magic. Basicaly their main goal is to reach far beyound the mortal reach
of magic. The second goal is to conquer and teach the lesser known people
what they have learned, If they see that magic is being misused,
misinterpreted, or such then Azurath members takes offense to this and
will not act kindly to it. Azurath is a kingdom where they will NOT avoid
a war if it comes to them. Azurath people do like causeing chaos and
mischief around Thera. They don't believe that anything can be gain by
being good or being evil. But they do believe that through war comes
power and through power comes knownledge. Azurath kingdom hungers for
power most of the time. They will have allies but only if it will help
their kingdom out more then they help them out.  All the classes are
welcomed since even warriors and thives should forget useing their brute
force only and combine steel with magic. Warriors and thives can not go
pass rank 1 for they will always be the Lost Apprentice for even starting
with that class.
 
Assassins, can go up to rank 2 for they have some magical power. Only
pure magical classes such as Mages, Necromancers, Druids, Maligners,
Prodigy's, Alchemist can become up to rank 10. The rest of the classes
beside Black Knights, Bards, Paladins can go up to only rank 8. The rest
can go up to rank 9. Although Azurath is a nuetral kingdom they will at
times go into war to gain something. We want to be left alone at times
but at times anger and corruption takes over and we go to war. Azurath's
goal is to Reach the new limite of Magic and find new powers.
And plus conquer and expend their knownledge.
 
Azurath will have 3 chosen Kings. One is Leader of Magic Slarith. Another
is Leader of Intelligence and Assassination Araenugeth.
Another leader is Conquer And Warfare Illidan.  If one king leaves the
kingdom or deletes. Then the other two will PICK one of their members
to be the next king. There will only be ONE rank 9 (The Advicer) for the
King Of Magic. There will be 2 Generals (Rank 8) one for Araenugeth and
another for Illidan. If one of their advicer's or General's should leave the
kingdom then their leaders will pick their own general or advicer again.
Also if someone leave the Kingdom of Azurath. They MIGHT be Punish if
the three kings chose to do so. For Our Main goal is Magic and conquer
and both things needs to be kept secret.
 
Azurath will goto war for these reasons:
 
ONE - If another kingdom attacks any of our members.
 
TWO - If uninvited guest should come into the area we own.
 
THREE - If we feel that they have disgrace or insult what we believe in.
Such as if they misuse their Magic and we feel that they are insulting 
the essence of Magic.
 
FOUR - If one kingdom should request us to help them fight another
kingdom or enemy. Then we will help ONLY in return for something we
believe that can help one of the Three Kings or the Kingdom itself. We
are power hungry people and will take any chance to gain power and name.

0 ALCHEMIST~
Alchemists are a jolly group of inventive magic users.  Though
lacking the sheer magical power of other mages, the alchemist is an
extremely useful friend to have. Their enhancing magics are greater
than any in the land.  Experienced Alchemists can perform several feats
including the long researched ability of transmogrification. Yes,
turning lead into gold. That is the foundation of Alchemy. Also, the
alchemistc can learn how to make wicked poison and empower weapons
and armor beyond the standard magical enhancement.  An Alchemist is
a useful class to have on your side.
~

0 ASSASSIN~
Masters of the art of weaponless combat, these mysterious warriors have
recently become more common in the land. They strike quickly and
silently before fading into the shadows. Assassins are skilled in the
knowledge of nerve pressure, and can weaken their foes with a well placed
strike. Assassins learn the art of assassination, killing their foe
instantly and silently.  Due to their belief that touching the blades of
their opponent with their own blade is a loss of honor, Assassins cannot
parry with swords. Assassins are usually very anti-social and have little
in common with those "normal" citizens in Thera. To Assassins, even other
Assassins are not to be associated with. They are considered competition
and even a bit of a threat. Assassins are evil by nature and though most
are chaotic, some have found it more useful to obey the laws of the 
cities. After all, nobody can stay in the city forever and even Advisors
slip up.
~

0 ASSASSINATE~
Syntax:  assassinate <target>

appearance, possibly because of the way he carries himself.
~

0 DRACONIAN~
{RGeneral:{B:  Draconians are one of the most unique and misunderstood
races in Thera.  Born of the long-ago union of dragon and human,
draconians retain the features of both their parent races.  They are
a cruel people in general, and will take any steps to insure they
get their cut.  
{RPersonality:{B  Draconians are intrinsically evil, and they are able to
immediately tell good creatures from others.  When they first
appeared, the draconians were outcasts from society, and had
to make do with whatever they could scavenge.  This scavenger
label has stuck with them somewhat over the generations, but
it isn't always true.  They are notorious backstabbers, and it
is ill-advised to trust a dragonman with your life.  They are
proud of their dragon heritage.
{RPhysical:{B  Draconians are a combination of dragons and men.
Their skin looks like a human's, but when the light catches
it just right, scales can be detected.  Draconians have small
horn protrusions that jut from their heads.  They are bipeds,
and usually have sharp fingernails like small talons.  Dracos
stand upright and have muscular frames, as well as wings
that allow for flight.  Their skin tones are usually red, blue,
black, white, or green, corresponding with the major types
of dragon.  Hair can be any color, as well as eyes.
{RRelations:{B  Draconians are manipulative and evil, thus they
do not make friends easily.  They associate best with the
other evil races of Thera, but will work with whomever 
they have to to get ahead.
{RAlignment:{B  Draconians are always evil.
{RSpecial:{B  Another aspect of their dragon heritage the
draconians claim is dragon breath.  Draconians can
breathe a cone of fire, affecting all enemies in the room.{x

0 DEATH~
When you die, you are reincarnated  in your hometown. Your corpse is
left behind where you died. Consider yourself lucky to find any of your
gear left in it. Being reincarnated is no minor deal. Every third death
results in the loss of a random stat.  However you lost con more often
than any other stats. Eventually you will have a constitution that is too 
low to render reincarnation. It is at that final point that you will NEVER 
again see life. You die for good!  So take care, it may be closer than 
you think...But then again most people do not seem to worry about it 
or even see it happen.
 
What people DO see however, are haunting spirits...
When you die, the spirits of all those players you have killed
come back to do various things to you. The more the merrier.
These spirits will wait for your spirit to be released always and
they can cause great trauma in large enough numbers. Nothing a hardy
adventurer could not recover from though. Also, some gods have
been known to destroy the haunting spirits,... for a good reason
 
You do NOT lose constitution or even experience from raw kills
where you have not a fighting chance...i.e. one hit wonders.
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
Following and groups are not affected by death.
 
You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose depends on 
your then experience points, your race, class and your previous deaths.

0 DWARF~
{RGeneral:{B:  Dwarves are short, tough and mighty.  They are well known
for patronizing the bars and taverns of Thera, and tales of their drinking
skills are legendary.  They are also known for their ferocious fighting
and warfare skills.  Many an orc or goblinoid has trembled in fear at
the thunderous rumble of a dwarven brigade charge.
{RPersonality:{B  The dwarven race is known for their toughness and
stubbornness.  Dwarves are not taken to flights of fancy, but neither are
they totally grim and humorless.  Family history, clan and personal honor
are of utmost importance to the dwarven race.  They take their duties
seriously, be they a warrior, guardsman, clergy, or merchant.  Dwarves
are also well known for their honesty, almost to the point of bluntness.
A dwarf would be a valuable ally and friend, and a fearsome enemy.
{RPhysical:{B  Dwarves are shorter that most humanoids, standing anywhere
from three to four and a half feet in height.  Their frames are very stocky
and muscular.  Dwarven men value facial hair, and rarely ever shave it.
Instead, their beards are worn long, with braiding and other such 
ornamentation.  It has been said that dwarf women also grow beards,
but this absurd notion would earn anyone so foolish to ask a firm slap
in the teeth.  Dwarven hair colors are normally black, brown, blonde
or red, but dwarves usually go grey quite early.  Eyes can also be any
color, really.  
{RRelations:{B  Dwarves trade openly with humans, giants and sometimes
ogres.  They also have relations with most other races, but do not 
seek them out especially.  Dwarves have no love for the evil races of
Thera, but their hatred of orcs (their ancestral enemies) is almost
unrivaled.  Very rarely will a dwarf be civil with an orc.
{RAlignment:{B  Dwarves are naturally good, and often wonder why the
hell everyone else can't be.
{RSpecial:{B  The dwarven constitution for alcohol is legendary.  With mighty
draughts that would fell a normal man, a dwarf is just getting warmed
up.  When in this drunken rage, a dwarf can fight better and takes less
damage from hits.  The better the alcohol, the higher their battle rage.{x
~

0 ALIGNMENT~
In the interest of attracting the right caliber of followers, the gods of
Deadland have outlined the following alignments.  See where you think you
fit in.
 
Lawful Good:   An orderly, strong society with a well-organized 
               government can make life better for the majority of the 
               people.  To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created 
               and obeyed.  When people respect the laws, and try to 
               help each other, society as whole prospers. 
 
Lawful Neutral:  Also believes in a strong, well-organized government, 
               whether it is a tyranny or democracy.  Organization and 
               regimentation bring benefits that outweigh any moral 
              questions raised by their actions.
 
Lawful Evil:   The use of society and its laws for personal benefit.  
               Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to 
               rule as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between 
               master and servant.  Laws and societies are supported so 
               long as they fit with personal concerns.  Laws are obeyed 
               out of fear of punishment
 
Neutral Good:  A balance of forces is important, but the concerns 
               of laws and chaos do not moderate the need for good.  The 
               universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for 
               different goals, so a pursuit of good will not upset the 
               balance.  Fostering good may mean supporting an organized 
               society, or overthrowing the existing social order.  Social 
               structure has no innate value.  
 
True Neutral:  Almost impossible to find such people as the majority 
               of people make judgments.  It is their duty to see that all 
               of the forces (evil, good, law, and chaos) remain in 
               balance.  Alliances with such people are odd, as they tend 
               to switch sides as one side brings the other to the point 
               of destruction.
 
Neutral Evil:  The primary concern for such people is their own 
               advancement.  Working with others or on their own, their 
               only interest is getting ahead.  Such people are known for 
               their 'Me, Myself, and I' personalities.  No scruples, no  
               conscience.
 
Chaotic Good:  Strong individualists marked with a streak of 
               kindness and benevolence.  Goodness and right matter, 
               but there is little use for laws and regulations.  Their 
               actions are morally good but may not be in perfect 
               agreement with the rest of society.
 
Chaotic Neutral:  There is no order to anything, even their own 
               actions.  Good and Evil are irrelevant when making a 
               decision.  They are almost totally unreliable, except for 
               the fact that you can rely on them being like this.  The 
               true coin-flipper, they rely on fate and chance to lead 
               them.
 
Chaotic Evil:  The bane of all that is good and organized.  Laws 
               and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to 
               fend for themselves.  The strong have a right to what 
               they want, and weak are there to be exploited.  
               Leadership among CEs is based on power, with the 
               leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience.  
 
Each god may accept a follower based on these outlines.

0 SERRATOR~
The kingdom known as Serrator began, when a young elven monk
by the name of Tharn had a vision.  He was the last elven monk
to ever live in Thera, as the guild had been forgotten among elves.
One day, while he was sleeping at an inn in Sanaria, he had a dream.
An angel send by the goddess of justice, Riannon, commanded him
to start a divine kingdom, following the will of the gods, and
bringing justice to all.  Tharn then began his search for people
who would believe in his vision and follow him.  The first one he
found was an Illithid by the name of Swirhun.  Tharn told him of
his vision, and he eagerly followed.  These two spread the word about
Thera, and soon a giant named Galberoth and a darnok named Niadh
decided to follow him.  The kingdom was ready to start.  Tharn
taught his followers how to pray, and worship, and all Serrator
members must.  Because Serrator is a kingdom of the divine, dark
magics are not widely used.  Therefore, dark-magic users may not
advance past rank 6, along with non-magic users.  Serrator is
divided into 4 sections, the heads of each form a council that
runs the kingdom.  This comes from a tradition that monks of
the Ivory Temple practice.  These 4 groups are called robes.
the first, and lowest group, consisting of ranks 1-3 is the red
robe, its leader being the Paige.  The next group is the yellow
robe, consisting of ranks 4-6, it's leader being the Seer.  The
next group is generally the most respected, it is the orange robe.
It consists of ranks 7-9, and all members of this robe are part of
the council.  The last group is the white robe.  The only person
in this group is the Cardinal, and leads the kingdom.  They head
the council.  All classes are accepted into Serrator, and may
advance by doing special things for the kingdom.

~

0 SERRATOR2~
Serrator is a fairly peaceful kingdom, devoting
most of their time to worshipping the divine.
Members shall not kill without first consulting
the council of robes.  Serrator shall make treaties
with all who practice peaceful measures and are
willing to be a worth ally.  Members lower than rank
9 can be advanced in rank by doing things helpful
to the kingdom or things that bring the kingdom
honor and glory.  However, non-spellcasters and
non-magic users cannot advance past rank 6.
The ideal member for Serrator would be one that is
a spellcaster, of good or neutral background, such
as a cleric or monk and is prepared to worship
the divine.  People wishing to join the
conclave must be of at least level 20, and must
inform the robe council about their wish to
join.
~

0 BUGS~
A bug is defined as an error or mistake within the coding of the mud or the
building of an area, that gives you an unfair advantage over other players
of the MUD, or anything within the game, that common sense tells you,
shouldn't be occuring.
 
If you come across a bug, you should first pray, and see if an imm is currently
on, as an administrator can gain more information through a direct conversation
with you than he/she would by going through a note.
 
If you pray, and do not receive a response, then you should write a note to
'admin' on board 3, describing the bug and the events that lead up to it.
Here are a few things to keep in mind when writing the note:
 
- Describe exactly what you think is wrong.
- What items are in your inventory, what room you're in, what mobs are
      near you.
- Try not to get upset by the bug.  If there is a problem, we want the bug
      resolved just as much as you do.
 
Remember, the abuse of a bug, as well as the non-reporting of bugs, is
considered a very delicate matter by the Admin Staff, and both of the
afore-mentioned actions can lead to you receiving harsh treatment from
the Admin Staff.
 
Punishments for the abuse of a bug or failure to report a bug can be
severe as a slay.  If the bug abused changes information pertaining to
your character (changes stats, skills, spells, hp/mana, etc), special
punishment if deemed necessary may occur.

*ONLY ALLOWED 7 PIECES OF LIMITED EQ IN YOUR INV*
 
Here on fate we have restrictions on the number of limited pieces
of equipment one person may carry.  They may have whatever they
are wearing plus 7 extra pieces in their inventory.  The only rule to the
7 pieces is that you may NOT have duplicates.  You may be wearing
an item and have one in your inventory but you may NOT have two
of the same limited item in your inventory.  Only acceptable duplicates
are wrist, neck, finger, ornamentation.
 
This rule will be done by using random checks on mortals and will be
upheld very strickly.  If you are found with even one piece of the 7 
limit max, you will be punished.  As punishment for anyone breaking this
rule, depending on how severe, your punishments will range anywhere from
loss of all extra limited equipment all the way up to a slay.  But
for the standard if you are found with too many, you will just lose all
your extras.

0 IMMORTAL~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 81
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.
Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.
The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies.

0 LURAI~
A long time ago, a young elf born in a noble and wealthy family
abandoned his town and life and vanished to the high mountains of Thera.
He left, with the disagreement of his father hoping to achieve something
no one has ever realized.
 
For years, he remained there meditating continuously...sitting on a
boulder sunrise after sunrise and sunset after sunset. His efforts 
were not in vain...after all the valiant hard work he had discovered
a new force, a new energy, a new magic which he calls potential energy,
Kii, or spiritual energy. This art of magic is hard to explain for it
still remains mysterious and highly varies from each individual. It is
created from within each creature and exists when they are born but few
are aware of its presence and even fewer know how to unleash it and
wield it.
 
The young elf had mastered this energy and had learned to wield it with
ease and skill. To master the force, a large amount of time and
concentration is required. Furthermore, one must have a clean heart and
soul in order to be able to master it. This young elf carried the name
of Lurai.
 
Years Later, an Elf named Legolas was taught the art of Kii by the
Master Lurai himself. 
 
The new disciple proves to be a great student that learns fast from 
the wise master. After several months of serious training, he has 
mastered alot from his tutor and was quite ready to depart on his own. 
 
But fate has its own ways of setting destiny, the next day, the Master
fell ill affected by great disease that isn
Legolas left to the greatest medicine brewers he knew and was given a
"remedy" that  proved to be useless on the grave disease the master had.
He had only one path open before him now....death.
 
On his death bed, the master calls his disciple and gives him his will... 
he had always wished to build a sanctuary, a stronghold,a kingdom for
all those pure of heart and mind that wish to devote themselves and
train theirselves into a new world of energy,a world of Kii, that no one
has ever  visioned or thought of. He asked his disciple to build his
dream: The kingdom of Lurai was born... 
 
As times goes by, kingdoms fall and kingdoms are born. Upon the will of
The Gods of Thera, the Order of Lurai as well as all the other kingdoms
of Thera feel and living of Thera  simply ceased to exist. Yet all was
not forgotten, the Tome written by Kii Master Legolas was preserved in
the Sanarian Library... 
The Tome of Ages 
 
Born in Elvander, an elf seeks to know more about the history of his
name, Legolas was his name. Upon his search he comes across with the
Tome of Ages. Guided by the God Salindor, Legolas discovered Kii. Taught
in dreams by  previous members of the Order, Legolas slowly learned to
wield Kii and as time went by, his mastering of the force grew... 
 
                           The Tome is Read
                           The Tale is Known 
                           The Order of Lurai

0 LURAI2~
Codex Lurai is a kingdom of Spiritual Energy and was created for
all those who wish to dedicate their lives into meditation and
mastering the force, which is called Kii.  In order to enter, one
must have a pure heart and is willing to dedicate his entire life to
the kingdom and its practices.  One must also be quite experienced in
the art of combat and/or magic and must have reached at least level
25 and will be tested in skills and knowledge before permitted
membership within Lurai.  The kingdom of Lurai accepts those of all
race, classes but Evil alignment creatures cannot join for the have
evil purpose and Seek destruction and do not hold pure minds and
hearts.  If permitted in the kingdom, the new member is given the
rank of student which he will hold for a minimum of 2 weeks.  And
this applies for each promotion.  One can not simply gain more than
one rank in a short period of time.  When a member is accepted in the
kingdom, he gives an oath to remain in the kingdom and should not
leave the kingdom without a valuable reason.  In order to get
promoted in the kingdom of Lurai, the student must be an active
member in the kingdom and will have his skills and knowledge tested
once more before he will be promoted.  The decision in regards of
this is made by the present high rank members of the kingdom.  Lurai
is a more of a neutral kingdom that mostly stands alone but in
certain circumstances, it takes allies to itself to achieve its
purpose.  This alliance does not end here but will remain to a long
term until a dispute arises between the allies.  The members of Lurai
are expected to mutually respect each other.  Any lower rank is
expected to treat all higher ranks as that of a mentor and a tutor. 
And higher rank should be helping lower ranks and give them advice
that will improve their skills and knowledge.  If any member has any
suggestion for the kingdom in order to improve it he is more than
welcome to place it and a decision will be made by ALL the active
members of the kingdom.

0 bounty2~
In order to place bounties upon other characters, the following
requirements must be met:
 
1)  IC interaction (disagreement) must occur previous to your placing
    the bounty upon the individual.  Also, an IC note must be written
    on board 3, to those whom are accepting the bounty.  Simply
    writing a note to admins, saying you've placed a bounty upon
    someone, without interacting with the individual the bounty is
    being placed upon, nor with the bountyhunter(s) who are accepting,
    will result in you being punished.
 
2)  You must have a sufficient background, that would support the IC
    disagreement, as well as morally allowing you to place the bounty.
 
3)  The reasons the bounty is placed, must be supported by your IC
    actions and beliefs.  It is also required that the reasons for
    which you are placing the bounty, must actually affect you in
    someway.  (Example:  Say Player A, murdered Player B.  If your
    RP involves being a murderous person, and you've no affiliation
    with Player B, then you cannot legitimately place the bounty,
    because in all reality, IC-wise, you would not care).
 
 
In order to accept bounties upon other characters, the following
requirements must be met:
 
1)  You must note admins, notifying them that your character accepts
    bounties (this need not apply to assassins).
 
2)  Your background, and previous rp, must be that which would support
    your character as being the type to accept bounties.  (Example:
    If your character was the leader of a peaceful kingdom, you would
    not be able to accept a bounty placed upon individual, due to
    morality issues and other IC beliefs, as your rp would not
    support it.)
 
3)  IC interaction with the person placing the bounty, must occur.
    It is also required that an IC note be written to you by the
    individual placing the bounty, that individual must note admins,
    and you too must note admins, informing the acceptance of the
    bounty that has been placed.
 
 
Essentially, lame bounty reasons placed on someone, so that you or your
friends may PK them freely, or simply because they have equipment you
desire to gain, *WILL NOT BE TOLERATED*.
 
PLEASE NOTE:  Players may still place bounties on board 2, but the requirements
still must be followed.
 
If you have any questions abount bounties, simply ask an admin, before
following through with the bounty.
 
SEE ALSO:  BOUNTYHUNTERS
~

0 PK~
The PK rule can be described as a combination of various rules involving
Player Killing, and is likely the most complex of rules in existance on Fate.
 
The following requirements must be met before a player can participate
in a PK:
 
- An appropriate background and description, as slated by their helpfiles.
- An IC reason/conflict between your character and the person you wish to attack.
      - The character stole from you, or a friend of yours.
      - The character is currently at war with your kingdom.
      - The character insulted you on isay or gossip, or antagonized you.
      - The character poses an IC threat to you (Their rp and actions hint that
            they may attack you - and use strong disgression here).
      - The character murdered you or a friend.
      - A bounty has been placed upon the individual. (see help bounty2)
      - Use common sense and good judgement.
 
If you and another character choose to duel, understand that both sides must
first agree, and also that duels are considered IC.  Please NOTE:
      - Treachery exists in Fate, and when participating in duels, you do
            so at your own risk.  The Admin Staff will not replace items lost
            in duels.
 
The following is *NOT* allowed during PK:
- OOL assistance (See: help OOL).
- PK'ing someone for an OOC reason.
- PK'ing someone your alt is at war with.
      - Read this as: If you die to someone on a char, you may not
            log on another alt in the same PK range in attempt to have
            your vengeance.
- PK'ing someone for leveling on a mob.
 
Following any PKs, a PK note is required to be written with 48
hours on board 6.  The note must contain both a OOC explanation,
and then an IC story of the events that occured leading up to the
death of your victim.
 
Punishment for breaking any of the PK rules can vary and severity,
and can result in a slay.  In very rare instances, a character will be
baled for excessive abuse of PK and ignoring the rules and regulations
set forth.  The Admin Staff understands that PK rules are very complex.
If you have any questions or concerns about a PK, simply ask an Admin
before following through with it.

0 bountyhunters~
Bountyhunting and hired PK is allowed on Fate. However, the following
guidelines must be followed.
 
(1) All requirements outlined in 'help pk' must be met by the person who
places the bounty. Effectively, they are initiating the PK, so all
onus is on them to have a good reason.
 
(2) Peforming a hired PK, and the PK itself, must not conflict with the
existing roleplay of the killer.
 
(3) The admins must be notified that a hired kill has taken place, since it
may be desireable to keep the deal secret. Therefore, both the killer and 
the person who hired him must write a note to 'admin' on board 3 out-lining
the deal. The bounty-placer must give a good PK reason in this note or he
will be punished for illegal PK.
~

0 pknote~
If you have killed another player, you must write a note to
board 6 within 48 hours giving a reason. If group pk occurs,
only the player who dealt the death blow must write a note.
The note must follow this format:
 
(1) It must contain an out of character section labeled OOC:
that gives a short explanation of your reason for the PK and
any other OOC notes.
 
(2) It must contain a longer in character section labeled IC:
that gives a detailed in-character account of the events from
your character's perspective.
 
PK notes are not optional and if you fail to write an accept-
able one, you may be punished for illegal PK.
~

0 "power leveling"~
Powerleveling is defined as excessive and continual aid from a highbie, while
an individual or group of lower-levels while leveling benefit from this.  An
example of this would be described as:
 
- A lvl 70 cleric, following around a group of lvl 30s, and continually healing
      the group, while deathfielding the mobs they are leveling on to make the
      mob easier to kill.
 
- A lvl 75 Maligner following a group, and repeatedly and excessively casting
      maledictions upon the mobs the group is leveling on.
 
Punishment for breaking the Power Leveling rule can result in punishment as
severe as a slay. In specific circumstances, punishment may be more severe
and less merciful, if for example, the power leveling was done by the player's
own alt, and then breaking both the Power Leveling and the Multi Playing rules.

0 gaiastorm~
The Confederation of Gaiastorm began as a dream that formed in the
hearts of like minded mortals from many walks of life on Thera.  The
tale begins, however, in the Elven nation of Elrorian, on the night
of a terrible storm.  Building for days, the storm finally broke,
dumping a hellacious downpour of thunderously violent proportions
over the Elven city.  Finally, at the storm's climax, a mighty bolt
of lightning struck the ground.  When the rains settled, the Elves,
much to their shock, found that a small human boy sat in a puddle at
the base of their famous Tree of Restoration.  The boy, Elial, was
taken in by the Elven clerics and raised among the fair folk.  The
Elves believed that he was the fulfillment of a prophecy, a child who
would help bring about the restoration of the balance of Nature and
lead mortalkind to a greater understanding of the natural world.  The
Elves gave Elial the title of "He Who Rides the Storm."  His later
adventures would lead to his coming of age and Vision Quest, an
ancient tradition that determines the course of a young person's
life.  During this quest, he encountered the being that identified
itself as the Green Man, an entitiy apart from both Gods and mortals.
The Green Man gave Elial visions of others who had the intrinsic love
of nature in their hearts, and sent him to seek them out.  In time,
he did.  Thus was born the Confederation of Gaiastorm, named so in
honor of the storm that bore Elial to the Elves, and for the ferocity
with which the love of the natural world burns within the souls of
its memebers.  Gaiastorm is not a nation per say.  They are very
loosely bound to the Warder, who acts as a first among equals and
diplomat of sorts.  Nations who submit to cooperative Gaiastorm rule
gain the benefit of the knowledge of many who work with the land,
air, soil and water.  Gaiastorm also takes great pride in the
reclaimation of barren and destroyed land, making it suitable for
re-settlement and growth.  They can be somewhat militant if need
calls for it, though protecting the wilderness and serving the Green
Man as the Avatar of Nature will always come first, before
politicking and empire-building.  
 
For information on Gaiastorm's ranks, membership standards and code of
conduct, see 'HELP GAIASTORM2'
~

0 Gaiastorm2~
Additonal information on Gaiastorm and the
offical Code of Conduct:
 
Alignments allowed:  Gaiastorm is welcoming to
nearly all walks of life, with a philosophically
neutral viewpoint being the prevailant mode of
thinking.  Those of good moral standing will find
little problem fitting in as well.  It has nearly
always rang true, however, that evil beings do not
respect the land or life.  Excepting very highly rare
cases, evil will not be welcome.
 
 
Races allowed:  All, with the near-always exception
of the more fell monster races of Thera, namely orcs
and trolls.  These races have a long and profane history
of atrocities committed agains the Green.  The memories 
of the trees are very long.  If a member of these races
wishes to join our ranks, it must be for an extremely
good reason, and they must be highly trustworthy. 
Exceptions are rare.
 
 
Classes:  Again, nearly all are welcome, excepting
Black-Knights and Maligners.  Necromancers are a total
anathema of life, and will not be welcomed.
 
 
The Ranks of Confederacy are as follows:
 
10.  Warder - the leader of Gaiastorm.  A first among
equals.
9.  Divine - the Spiritual Advisor of the Warder, and
second-in-command.
8.  Stormguard - leaders of defense.  There shall be
at any point in time up to two for melee and two for
magical representation.
7.  Gnostic - scholars, keepers of the histories and lore
of Gaiastorm.
6.  Sentinel - the Elite Wilderness Defenders.
5.  Seeker - patrols the wilderlands.
4.  Preserver - aids in healing the land, and the restor-
ation of nature.
3.  Woodsman/mistress - the caretakers of the wilds, both
flora and fauna.
2.  Medicine Man/Woman - learns more of ancient lore, craft
and traditions of Gaiastorm.
1.  Scout - initiate level, a student of the Confederacy.
 
Those interested in joining the Confederacy should first
look into their hearts and see if they meet the qualifications.
You should then make your intentions known to the Warder, and
then to the world by public delcaration (RP board).  We will
then let you know.

The system is fairly straightforward.  Depending on the level
of the item, you have a variable number of points to spread
around on the bonuses.  Different types of items or bonuses
have different costs.  This is a breakdown of points vs. level.
 
LEVEL        POINTS
Newbie        4
1-5          3
6-10          6
11-15         9
16-20         12
21-25          15
26-30         18
31-35         21
36-40         24
41-45         27
46-50         30
51-55         32
56-60         34
61-65         36
66-70         38
71-75         40  
76-100        +1 point per 2 levels above 75
 
STANDARD STAT BONUSES
Bonus            Cost
+1 Stat           6 points
+3 hp/mana        1 point
+1 hit or dam     3 points
+1 to one save    3 points

For armor AC bonuses:
First, use AUTOSET to set the standard AC value for
the armor.  Then, for an AC bonus, the formula is:
2 points for every 3 points of AC.  (-3 AC = 2 points, -6 = 4 points, etc.)
 
For weapon damage:
First set the weapon damage using AUTOSET, and modify it from there.
There are two values that tell how much damage a weapon does, the number
of dice and the dice size (i.e. 3d8).  You can increase either number at a
cost of 5 points for the first increase, and an additional 2 points for each
successive increase.  The first increase is 5 points, second is 7, third
is 9, and so on.  (21 points total for three increases).
 
 
Added affects for weapons:
For effects like flaming, freezing, vorpal, etc - the first affect
costs 5 points.  An additional 2 points is added to the cost
for each additional affect, same as with weapon damage.
 
 
For spell affects:
Having a permanent spell effect on a weapon is a RARE thing, and
therefore finding a weapon or armor with one should be a difficult
thing to do.  A minor spell effect is 25 points.  A minor spell is
classified as any spell that offers a modest beneficial effect, such
as ARMOR or SHIELD.  
A MAJOR spell effect costs 40 points.  Major spells are such things
as haste, spells that are common but much more powerful.
NOTE -- spells such as SANC, PROTECTION GOOD/EVIL, and the higher
level protection spells are for QUEST ITEMS ONLY.  
 
For negative bonuses:
Basically, adding a negative bonus gives points back, but at half
of the rate.  For example, a -1 DEX would only give back 3 points,
and it would require -6 HP to give a single point back.  Adding
a CURSE flag gives no points back.  Adding a negative spell, such
as poison, plague, or blind gives an additional 10 points back.
 
 
Immunities:
Immunities should never appear on standard equipment without the
consent of the Head Administrator.

Adding Affects can be a little tricky depending upon what you are
trying to do.  But if you are wanting to add stats, hp, mana, etc. 
To your items this is the way to do it.  
 
Syntax:  addaffect [location] [#xmod]
 
The location is the affect taht you are wanting to add.
 
Valid affects are:
none               strength           dexterity          intelligence       
wisdom             constitution       mana               hp                   move               ac                 hitroll            damroll             saves              savingpara         savingrod          savingpetri        savingbreath       savingspell        spellaffect        
 
#xmod is the number at which you want to add.  Example:
 
Addaff Strength 2 - would add 2 strength stat points to a piece of
equipment.  Remember that you can add negative affects as well as
positive affects.
