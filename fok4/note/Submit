Subject Drama~
Text
Ok,
 
 
I don't wanna make this into a long letter or anything
so I will keep it brief and to the point.
I in no way,shape or form had anything to do with Macha's action's and him
posting notes on the forum,Macha is his own man and persoanlly if
you ask me i don't like to be involved in all the dramatics.
I'd rather do other things with my time.
Actually if anything i've tried stickin up for zalev,just when
thing's were seen on ooc or openly admitted on public channels
by zalev mort's didnt like it,cause some of the actions
zalev was doing is not permitted period.Most of us here
are fok veterans and we all know this.Yes people would tell me
things about zalev this or that,but personally i figure hes havin tuff times irl.
So i personally turn away from it even tho i dont agree with some of the things.
 
 
 
But just to get this straight i never fueled macha or tried swaying anyone to turn
against zalev or anyone,i want this place to succeed and see the playerbase grow.
So I don't encourage anything negative on my part in all honesty.
 
So mainly im writing this note out of two peoples response's to me earlier
and accusations saying i'm a part of the reason of macha's actions.I just wanted 
to get that straight.

Subject Wand and Staff drops~
Text
Just an idea:
 
Maybe instead of making all wands and staff drop's level 1.
Maybe you could make them from level 1 to wtv current level the mobile is.
The chances of the level and spell on the wand/staff would be a random
roll of course.But that's just plain out cheese when a level 55 mobile drops
level 1 crap all the time.
 
 
My two cent's,
