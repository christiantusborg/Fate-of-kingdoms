K, so, I was talking and someone said "head on a pole"
 
Great idea, imo. Allow generals to put peoples heads on pikes
outside cities. Will demoralize the opposing army a bit, perhaps
a downside to their army as well a bit. dunno. Can only be used
when defending.
 
Zaeleir gets 5 percent credit, as he's the one who said the
head on a pole thing :)

Since Kazmir has decided to fuck up all our plans simply by
sitting by and doing nothing, not even giving access to those
who need it to get the ball rolling, I'm taking off.
 
Contact me if this can ever get rolling. Its a lost cause as
it stands now.

Subject Abusing Commands~
Text
And just for the record:
 
Anyone I find abusing any command such as the little outfit thing
will be balefired. No questions asked.
 
I may allow you to plea bargain down by turning in others who have
abused it.
 
Oh, and your subject to having your higher levels punished as well.
So don't start a new character, abuse the bug, and think your all
safe.
 
Have a nice day :)
