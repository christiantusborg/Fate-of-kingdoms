Im so sick of this guy, this is the about 5th time ive bitched about 
him either through msn, ooc, tell and notes now. Im sick of trying
to play, writing my background, rping, every fucking bit of this game
i do and i have to listen to his faggot mouth. He has to nit pick at 
SOMETHING all the time and then when i defend myself i always get
 "stop whining" or and i quote [OOC] Macha: 'as you said before mikael
fuck off and go be emo in a corner'
 
 
Seriously, im trying to mature approach first and reporting it, but
it doesnt seem to be working. If it comes down too it then itll just
be me giving him a reason to bitch at him.
 
And now that is not a threat, im just pissed and sick and tired of his
shit.

You see standing before you a young looking drow with a muscular, 
athletic build and slightly above average height. He would look like 
any other drow except for his grey tinted skin and piercing black eyes.
He has long silvery, white hair that is tied back from his face which
only draws more attention to his interesting eyes.

Moglan has been hired to help me with the eq also, im 
slowly getting a small army to work on this.  Moglan
is a old player that doesnt want to play mortal anymore
he stoped in to check it out and said he wasnt here to 
play just checking in and i asked if he wanted to help
cause he is a good friend who likes the game also.
 
So right now i have Moglan and Caele supposed to be
working on the eq.  Caele should get this note...
GET BUSY BITCH!!!...but ok...im outty.

The old man has it yea, not sure what the drop chances are.
And it's hidden, but you knew that :)
Might be like heirloom, but I doubt it has that low spawn chance.
Anyways, lemme know if you need someone with det hidden, I'll help
ya out if you help me get a pair :)

I checked in today and noticed that you were at the healer
with 2 corpses and were starving.  I forced you to pick up
all of your gear and gold and disconnected you and unloaded
you.  If you are going to set up triggers to keep your player
online make sure you set up triggers to keep him eating and
drinking too.

As much as I would like to have Macha back; what was happening
I do not believe to be healthy for anyone.  Especially given
that according to Macha he set his msn to block Zalev.
 
Given this, I am not sure Macha would agree to what you 
have written; and if he did, I am not sure it would be
any good to anyone.  At some point, if someone is truly
unhappy, and there appears no way to rectify the problem (which
was the case); then there is only one solution, which Macha choose
on his own desire.
 
Anyways I am sorry your plans were affected by this entire
travisty.
