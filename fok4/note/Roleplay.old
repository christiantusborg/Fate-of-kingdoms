The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that
burned in Kormien's heart like the pale heavenly orb overhead.
What's the purpose, this time?
 
What am I here?
 
 
And for how long?

As I open my eyes on Thera once again I realize that nothing
remains. My kingdom, my Thera, my Lord. All has been destroyed
but for what I do not know or understand. The ongoing struggle
in the heavens destroys us and creates us again at their whim. 
Puppets to the will of the immortals, so that we may dance 
for there amusement. 
 
I have seen the fires of hell, and been burned with the everlasting
flame from the pit, but the presence of my master I do not feel.
I am reborn but for purposes unknown to me, but this is the way it
must be. Only the loyal will get the reward and the fools will perish
by the sword. My master will summon me and we will once again 
set our hordes upon Thera oott  fjdkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

I can't figure why my hands write in this hamfisted way, or why 
I am constantly wearing these ugly clothes or most importantly
where my wings are? OH well, I shuold probably go back to the tree,
Thera is so beautifull, i'm overjoyed by the fact that our divine
creators have remade us in there image. Kazmir has surely
blessed us. I hope everyone has come back, and those vial
guards aren't in our home. Well hopefully everyone has come back,
but if not i'm sure that the glorious immortals have found cause
to not grant them rebirth. Well off to my friends.
 
 
Thus is the plight of Trythog, the one might Demon Lord of Narssius 
.d
This is the evidence i put forward to have the troll named Trythog
permanently incarcerated in Arkham. Clearly his mind is cracked,
all this talk about masters and burning Thera, and kingdoms. 
Everyone knows that there are no kingdoms and never have been on
Thera. We have been at peace since our immaculate birth thousands
of years ago. If spotted please do not believe or play along with
him, because clearly he is confused.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that

What's the purpose, this time?

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that
burned in Kormien's heart like the pale heavenly orb overhead.
What's the purpose, this time?
 
What am I here?
 
 
And for how long?

As I open my eyes on Thera once again I realize that nothing
remains. My kingdom, my Thera, my Lord. All has been destroyed
but for what I do not know or understand. The ongoing struggle
in the heavens destroys us and creates us again at their whim. 
Puppets to the will of the immortals, so that we may dance 
for there amusement. 
 
I have seen the fires of hell, and been burned with the everlasting
flame from the pit, but the presence of my master I do not feel.
I am reborn but for purposes unknown to me, but this is the way it
must be. Only the loyal will get the reward and the fools will perish
by the sword. My master will summon me and we will once again 
set our hordes upon Thera oott  fjdkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

I can't figure why my hands write in this hamfisted way, or why 
I am constantly wearing these ugly clothes or most importantly
where my wings are? OH well, I shuold probably go back to the tree,
Thera is so beautifull, i'm overjoyed by the fact that our divine
creators have remade us in there image. Kazmir has surely
blessed us. I hope everyone has come back, and those vial
guards aren't in our home. Well hopefully everyone has come back,
but if not i'm sure that the glorious immortals have found cause
to not grant them rebirth. Well off to my friends.
 
 
Thus is the plight of Trythog, the one might Demon Lord of Narssius 
.d
This is the evidence i put forward to have the troll named Trythog
permanently incarcerated in Arkham. Clearly his mind is cracked,
all this talk about masters and burning Thera, and kingdoms. 
Everyone knows that there are no kingdoms and never have been on
Thera. We have been at peace since our immaculate birth thousands
of years ago. If spotted please do not believe or play along with
him, because clearly he is confused.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that

What's the purpose, this time?

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that
burned in Kormien's heart like the pale heavenly orb overhead.
What's the purpose, this time?
 
What am I here?
 
 
And for how long?

As I open my eyes on Thera once again I realize that nothing
remains. My kingdom, my Thera, my Lord. All has been destroyed
but for what I do not know or understand. The ongoing struggle
in the heavens destroys us and creates us again at their whim. 
Puppets to the will of the immortals, so that we may dance 
for there amusement. 
 
I have seen the fires of hell, and been burned with the everlasting
flame from the pit, but the presence of my master I do not feel.
I am reborn but for purposes unknown to me, but this is the way it
must be. Only the loyal will get the reward and the fools will perish
by the sword. My master will summon me and we will once again 
set our hordes upon Thera oott  fjdkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

I can't figure why my hands write in this hamfisted way, or why 
I am constantly wearing these ugly clothes or most importantly
where my wings are? OH well, I shuold probably go back to the tree,
Thera is so beautifull, i'm overjoyed by the fact that our divine
creators have remade us in there image. Kazmir has surely
blessed us. I hope everyone has come back, and those vial
guards aren't in our home. Well hopefully everyone has come back,
but if not i'm sure that the glorious immortals have found cause
to not grant them rebirth. Well off to my friends.
 
 
Thus is the plight of Trythog, the one might Demon Lord of Narssius 
.d
This is the evidence i put forward to have the troll named Trythog
permanently incarcerated in Arkham. Clearly his mind is cracked,
all this talk about masters and burning Thera, and kingdoms. 
Everyone knows that there are no kingdoms and never have been on
Thera. We have been at peace since our immaculate birth thousands
of years ago. If spotted please do not believe or play along with
him, because clearly he is confused.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that

What's the purpose, this time?

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that
burned in Kormien's heart like the pale heavenly orb overhead.
What's the purpose, this time?
 
What am I here?
 
 
And for how long?

As I open my eyes on Thera once again I realize that nothing
remains. My kingdom, my Thera, my Lord. All has been destroyed
but for what I do not know or understand. The ongoing struggle
in the heavens destroys us and creates us again at their whim. 
Puppets to the will of the immortals, so that we may dance 
for there amusement. 
 
I have seen the fires of hell, and been burned with the everlasting
flame from the pit, but the presence of my master I do not feel.
I am reborn but for purposes unknown to me, but this is the way it
must be. Only the loyal will get the reward and the fools will perish
by the sword. My master will summon me and we will once again 
set our hordes upon Thera oott  fjdkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

I can't figure why my hands write in this hamfisted way, or why 
I am constantly wearing these ugly clothes or most importantly
where my wings are? OH well, I shuold probably go back to the tree,
Thera is so beautifull, i'm overjoyed by the fact that our divine
creators have remade us in there image. Kazmir has surely
blessed us. I hope everyone has come back, and those vial
guards aren't in our home. Well hopefully everyone has come back,
but if not i'm sure that the glorious immortals have found cause
to not grant them rebirth. Well off to my friends.
 
 
Thus is the plight of Trythog, the one might Demon Lord of Narssius 
.d
This is the evidence i put forward to have the troll named Trythog
permanently incarcerated in Arkham. Clearly his mind is cracked,
all this talk about masters and burning Thera, and kingdoms. 
Everyone knows that there are no kingdoms and never have been on
Thera. We have been at peace since our immaculate birth thousands
of years ago. If spotted please do not believe or play along with
him, because clearly he is confused.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Everyone knows that there are no kingdoms and never have been on
Thera. We have been at peace since our immaculate birth thousands

him, because clearly he is confused.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Well it has been almost 4 months sense I have come back to Thera.
It is a sad truth but this planet is dying.  Someone or something
is draining it.  I have sung a song to lay a protection on the
planet which has stopped the decay...every ranger, druid, shaman
should notice its effects before too long.
 
Well a world without heros isn't going to be able to save it.
I really really can't stand orcs.  The traditional orc is dumb
and stupid.  Those that aren't traditional are egotistical and
greedy.  Evil by nature.  However, though he didn't know it I
saw an orc today who I have decided will begin the rebuilding of
thera.  I have decided to send Kruik a vision in one of his dreams,
letting him know the gods find him favorable to replace his old
tribe and more if he but want it.  However to begin his quest he
must find the only orc ranger in existance.  The only problem with
the way shamans commune is the method is alot less sure than that
of clerics, who knows if he understood what I told him.  One thing
I know, he certainly has no clue I sent it, and if he did who I am.
 
Should be at least amusing if nothing else.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that
burned in Kormien's heart like the pale heavenly orb overhead.
What's the purpose, this time?
 
What am I here?
 
 
And for how long?

As I open my eyes on Thera once again I realize that nothing

Well it has been almost 4 months sense I have come back to Thera.
It is a sad truth but this planet is dying.  Someone or something
is draining it.  I have sung a song to lay a protection on the
planet which has stopped the decay...every ranger, druid, shaman
should notice its effects before too long.
 
Well a world without heros isn't going to be able to save it.
I really really can't stand orcs.  The traditional orc is dumb
and stupid.  Those that aren't traditional are egotistical and
greedy.  Evil by nature.  However, though he didn't know it I
saw an orc today who I have decided will begin the rebuilding of
thera.  I have decided to send Kruik a vision in one of his dreams,
letting him know the gods find him favorable to replace his old
tribe and more if he but want it.  However to begin his quest he
must find the only orc ranger in existance.  The only problem with
the way shamans commune is the method is alot less sure than that
of clerics, who knows if he understood what I told him.  One thing
I know, he certainly has no clue I sent it, and if he did who I am.
 
Should be at least amusing if nothing else.

The angry eye of the Gods roared overhead.
 
 
"Damnedable sun," the humanoid figure muttered.  "I forgot
just how bright the thing really is."  Kormien sa'Gorn,
the Bane of Angels, the Keeper of...nothing.  Titles didn't
matter now.  The past didn't matter now.  All he had known,
from the cult of Narssius to the omnipresent hordes of the
grand experiment of Torsanctus...all were gone.  Broken, and
scattered to the four winds.
 
 
Days since his return to the land of the living, Kormien had
once again set up a home in the ubiquitous metropolis of
Sanaria.  Why?  Who knew.  It seemed like the thing to do.
Perhaps it was just force of habit that drew him once again
to Sanaria's teeming thousands.  Or maybe it was that old
curse, nostalgia, pushing at him once again.  The fact of 
the matter was that he was here, and, more importantly, that
he simply WAS again.
The transformation from the afterlife had been relatively
painless.  Though, in coming back to the Prime Material plane,
he had brought with him the essence of Zelphax, the overthrown
Greater Demon.  Why had Zelphax chosen to come back in this
fashion, in the now-half-demon form of one of his old supporters?
A most loyal supporter, yes, but one who was overthrown.  Defeated.
Zelphax hated defeat.  Why, then, was it this way?
 
 
Most importantly, though...was why.  Why was the query that
burned in Kormien's heart like the pale heavenly orb overhead.
What's the purpose, this time?
 
What am I here?
 
 
And for how long?

As I open my eyes on Thera once again I realize that nothing
remains. My kingdom, my Thera, my Lord. All has been destroyed
but for what I do not know or understand. The ongoing struggle
in the heavens destroys us and creates us again at their whim. 
Puppets to the will of the immortals, so that we may dance 
for there amusement. 
 
I have seen the fires of hell, and been burned with the everlasting
flame from the pit, but the presence of my master I do not feel.
I am reborn but for purposes unknown to me, but this is the way it
must be. Only the loyal will get the reward and the fools will perish
by the sword. My master will summon me and we will once again 
set our hordes upon Thera oott  fjdkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
dfvgg
 
 
 
I can't figure why my hands write in this hamfisted way, or why 
I am constantly wearing these ugly clothes or most importantly
where my wings are? OH well, I shuold probably go back to the tree,
Thera is so beautifull, i'm overjoyed by the fact that our divine
creators have remade us in there image. Kazmir has surely
blessed us. I hope everyone has come back, and those vial
guards aren't in our home. Well hopefully everyone has come back,
but if not i'm sure that the glorious immortals have found cause
to not grant them rebirth. Well off to my friends.
 
 
Thus is the plight of Trythog, the one might Demon Lord of Narssius 
.d
This is the evidence i put forward to have the troll named Trythog
permanently incarcerated in Arkham. Clearly his mind is cracked,
all this talk about masters and burning Thera, and kingdoms. 
Everyone knows that there are no kingdoms and never have been on
Thera. We have been at peace since our immaculate birth thousands
of years ago. If spotted please do not believe or play along with
him, because clearly he is confused.

Dear journal,
 
It has been a long time sense I was last on Thera.  Other
than some isolated locations, Thera is completely a mess.
Not a single kingdom exists, and as such the people of 
Thera have no protection, no guide, and as such, have no
hope.  Already it seems new heros and villians born; but
it seems there are more villians born this time around
than heros.  Should something not happen soon, this world
is going to cry out in pain and everyone will die, just
as it had happened before.
 
Alas, I can not do much as per the ancient contract, for
what happens to this world is mortals choice; however,
perhaps, if the strings were pulled right the people
of this world might have a hope... a chance at life
once again.

Dear journel,
 
I was petitioning for another hero to try and save this world,
when I learned of a great and sad thing.  My old mentor and
teacher had passed away... apparently he had sacrified himself
many years ago to save the world.  If I had somehow heard, I
would have returned sooner, rather than by the call of the
planet but to help fullfill the void left by such a great
god having fallen.  Hell maybe had I not gone off in search
for my family, things could have been different.  At anyhow
it is best not to change the past, and besides that would 
proably anger Explorer anyhow, and his death was noble.  Well
in the less, this spot will act as the empi center for the
healing of the planet.  If nothing else, maybe whoever is
causing this will think Derkec returned.

"No Mikael, I don't ask for his excuse, I ask for how such discipline could be 
placed into you, but not a sibling raised by the same family."
 
An expression of confusion crossed Mikael's face. What sort of path could his
brother actually be following to draw such attention.. and why the questions..
 
"Yes yes Mikael, it would only be right for you to have questions. Well, questions
shall wait, for now, you will listen." The man before the young paladin wiped his
brow slowly with a white cotton pad. "Where to start, where to start.. you deserve
to know straight forward.. your brother, I have been told, has taken up refuge 
inside the Black Citadel. As you know.. such a place has spit out many dreadful
creatures, as well as Death Knights with enough power and rage to cause us quite 
alot of pain in earlier days. Now.. what you don't know is that this Citadel..
for hundreds of years believed uncontrolled, uninhabited, have seem to start
teeming with new life.. young humans, drows, duegar alike have been seen entering
and leaving its cursed walls. It seems, Mikael, your brother is traveling the
path in which power controls, hatred flows, and death reeks. Do not fret with 
this now young one, go about your ways for now, sleep, I shall summon you tomorrow."
 
 
Such information, forced about a young human so fast, Mikael stood there, dazed as
the man walked away from him before he could protest. Shaking away his state of awe
Mikael returned to his room..
