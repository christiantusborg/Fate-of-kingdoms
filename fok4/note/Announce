All that have come back have had the same suggestion.  We need to
advertise more.  I am going to be talkin to Explorer to get the page
for a web page.  I will build it if no one else will but if anyone can
draw or if anyone wants to do the finger work and find some good
pictures for the web page that would be great.  If someone wants 
to take up the Myspace page for fate I will help.  I have a banner
already that is set up to open telnet and connect to fate.  I just 
need help with all this and anyone that wants to help is welcome
to.  Write me a note on board 3 if you wish to help and what you 
can do to help.  Thank you all for coming back.

This is my solication for mortal help.  Here is what I am 
looking for.
 
First I need someone to write down any ideas they see off
the submit board.  This will help tremendiously as I am very
forgetful and forget todo it myself.
 
Second, I need people to post bugs and hacks.  Even if they are
things everyone should know.  Those things please only post to
the imms.
 
Third I would like skill ideas.  Similar to the vision spell.
But unless you only want a mundane version of your idea implemented
here are some guidelines to keep in mind:
a) keep it simple! Remember the theory of thermal laziness:
"The probability of a new skill being implemented is
 inversly propotional to its complexity"
b) make it a counter to a currently existing skill.  For example
   I remember when charge was the rage and would wipe the butt
   of everyone else.  If I had to balance it today, I would make
   it so if someone had a pike equiped they would do all the damage
   of the charge back at the person who used it.
c) come up with the skill and its counter simultanously.
d) make it restrictive.
             maybe it only works at night?
 
Anyways just some thoughts.  My idea is to make it so that eventually
every class gets a skill (or improvement to a skill) every other level.

They need redone as well. Instead of these bigger skills that do damage
or buff, Im thinking of a few smaller enhances.
 
For example, arials came up today.
Remove swooop. Allow them to cross all terrain (even the high
mountains). Give them a little bit of a plus evasion to
physical damage, and but increase their damage taken by bows.
 
Things like that I like much better than the current skills.

Subject Ideas~
Text
K, heres a few ideas that I have discussed with others,
and probably a few that I haven't. Hard to keep track :)
 
New, very large world map. Leveling NPCs would be placed
on this world map. Most of the areas we have would be
done away with...they just take up space as it is anyway.
Major cities, some minor cities, and a few of the areas
we like would be linked in. This does a few things. For
one, it makes it more newbie friendly, as areas of the
map would be set up for certain level ranges, thus you
don't wander into the Forbidden Forest at level 20, because
that won't be in the level 20 section. A second is it allows
us to purely focus on a leveling range that needs help.
We could open up other continents as they become ready.
 
Areas would be more like 'dungeons.' This is where your
better gear would be found, rather than what you could buy
in the cities.
 
 
Autoset- its broken. Needs to be based on the level of the
item, the location of wearing the item, and the type of
item (daggers would hit for less than swords. Cloth armor
would be less effective than plate). Autoset could also be
set up to assign material type based on these things. Or
the material flags could be hardcoded and limited to certain
level ranges (titanium couldn't be on a level 1 item.)
 
Items should be level restricted to avoid people creating
super characters by giving their characters lots of +stat
gear at level 1.
 
Leveling cap placed at 50 for the time being. This allows us
to work from the ground up and open up the upper levels in
segments. Allows for 'expansion' type elements as well as
easier balancing.
 
Salindor has a pretty good system for an army system. He has
details on that.
 
+stats on equipment limited by level. Id prefer this hard coded
to keep builders from going crazy on gear. Can be overridden by
those level 90 or above (admins), for the creation of quest gear.
 
Limited eq should only be quest gear. If its really good, make
it hard to get and have a low spawn chance.
 
Spawning of items needs changed a bit. Instead of having a chance
each tick, make it so the NPC needs to be killed for it to have
a chance to spawn.
 
Instead of taking all the potions out, put cooldown timers on them.
 
Cooldown timers on spells, rather than lots of lag (Salindor said
this, great idea).
 
Races and classes need balanced. Some are just inferior.
 
I know I have more, but I can't think at the moment...
 
If you have questions or comments, please post :)

Subject armies~
Text
I am going to break my army idea up into several notes
because there is alot of detail to them.  Some of you have
heard this before, but I am adjusting it slightly trying
to fix some of the flaws I had with previous revisions of
the idea.
 
Basically an army is unit which represents a collection
(1000's) of troops (could you imagine walking into a room
full of 10000 npc's).
 
Because army warfare is fundamentally different from 
individual warfare, combat between players and armies
will be forbidden.  Exactly what will happen between 
a player getting too close to an army I haven't nailed
down yet.  I was considering letting that be the choice
of a general from, repulsion, to killing, to maybe capturing?
 
An army can either be on the world map, or it can be stationed
in a city.  Those stationed in cities are considered
automatically fortified, and are unflankable.  
 
Those moving on the world map are very flankable, but that
will be the only means to move troops around, or attack 
enemy cities.
 
Armies would only be given so many pts they can spend per
rl day they can use.  This will give opposing kingdoms time
to set up orders for the army and add an element of strategy
to the game.
 
Relative position of one army to another matters.

Subject ordering armies around~
Text
The king of each kingdom is automatically considered the head
general.  The king has the authority to designate other kingdom
members as generals.
 
Only a general may command an army.  Anybody else could be used
to help the 'general' get to his army (might be an interesting 
tatic to deny the generals access to their armies, but that
could be taken care of by hiding behind the army).
 
Once on the army the army is split up sections that can be
ordered:
    army - commmand the entire army todo something
    corp - command a portion of the army todo something.  An 
           army can only have 4 corps
    regiment - command a regiment of the army todo something. An
           army can only have 10 regiments per corp.  A regiment
           is approximately between 500 to 1000 men.
 
The following are orders that can be given:
    formation (army level only) - commands the army to take on a 
           new formation(more information on this later).
    move - move the target to a different realitive position within
           the army.
    defend - sets up against a charge.  
    charge - attacks the enemies army
    drill  - teaches your army how to fight (slowly) and helps build
             moral (slowly)
    blast  - orders the mages in the army to let the other army know
             why mages are indespincable in any army situation
    digin  - causes the army to begin digging trenches, setting up 
             spikes, etc etc to make attacking them much harder.  Once
             complete, they will switch from digging in to defending
             automatically.

K, so, I was talking and someone said "head on a pole"
 
Great idea, imo. Allow generals to put peoples heads on pikes
outside cities. Will demoralize the opposing army a bit, perhaps
a downside to their army as well a bit. dunno. Can only be used
when defending.
 
Zaeleir gets 5 percent credit, as he's the one who said the

Text
Ok, I just got home and heard that there was some complaining
about the level cap that has now been impossed to level 55
because we have already had players surpass the initial cap
that we wanted of level 50. For what we plan to do to race/class
and levels, it will be easier to have a level cap for the time
being or we will be forced to do a pwipe afterwards.  If you
prefer the pwipe and to regain ALL levels afterwards we will
let you continue to play past level 55.  Use this time to make 
other characters and get them to level 55 also.  We are trying
to improve the game, it has much needed this for many years.
Please bare with us through this transition.

Text
Now that people are starting to rp more (or better be hint hint)
I thought I should go over a couple of rules for having your
rp accepted by the community at large and not minimalized or
removed.
 
Things which affect the world require admin approval, otherwise
their only affect is in your head.  
 
If what your rping is some form of power, it can be no stronger
than what your character can do in game (i.e. no mages that can
move mountains).
 
No mortals (that means you) were around during the previous era
of fate.  You can be great grandchildren if you want, but your
not the actual person.  The exception would be malgad (who is really
a demi-god) and nobody knows how old he is.
 
The good news, is if you want to exagerate how great an old kingdom
was, there would be no mortal around who would know different.
 
Lastly Thera has been in chaos with no major organizations of any
kind for several years.  Most knowledge was lost, and travel has just
reopened up.  Your characters represent the first heros or villians
in the land for as long as anybody can remember.

Subject background material~
Text
First think first, if I critique your background take it like a
man; I am not out to get you, but I am trying to help
make it so your story is someone what plausable.
 
Given that, when writting it think small, things that happen
in your background all happen before level 15.
 
So ask the following questions: could a level 15 pull this off?
If the answer is no, then it can only have happened in your head.
 
Can my class pull this off, with the skills given to them at level
15? Again, if the answer is no, then this can only have happened
in your head.
 
Is it likely another player would have wanted to stop me? If the
answer is yes, then save it for rp in the game, and only if you
succeed can you add it to your background.
 
Killing average people in your background is acceptable (altough
depending on how and when there should be conseqences).  I realize
that this world is not dynamic, but when you write your background
you should act like it is.  Cities have patrols, people have magic,
and the ability to see magic.  Killing major officals in major cities,
save it for rp in game.  
 
Take the following example, lets say I play a human warrior, and in
my background I write that I conquered the world (I don't go small on
anything) and how nobody who came up against me was able to stand
against my might.  Now I am level 20, and someone pks me.  Opps guess
that background couldn't have happened now could it?
 
Anyways, keep this in mind.  If your character is 'too good' it will
be impossible to use him in any quests, and I will just consider it
all to be empty bragging.

I found Stel today with a background and desc of just
a bunch of letters.  He has been placed in the Void
untill he fixes it.  I will leave Salindor to check it
and make sure it is ok.  However I will let him out as soon
as he has something there at least worth reading. :P

Subject Gintid Ring~
Text
{R**************The Gintid Ring Curse**************{x
 
{BThe Curse of the Ginted Ring was Implemented because (like Macha said)
certain members of certain {YKINGDOMS{B both abused the ring by keeping
more than one in their inventory and once the code was changed to where
it hurt you by having multiple in your inventory one tried giving the
rings to their opponent during a PK.  Therefore the ring was then set
to kill you on site if you tried to give it away.
 
{CNow I agree that this should have been stated for those who have
not played the game before/ in the past year, and this will be rectified.
Also I will talk to Salindor/Kazmir about changing the code so that it
can not be given away and is melt drop instead of killing the person
that is giving it away.

Subject Implementor Administrators and Mortals~
Text
I will make this real simple.
 
Zalev and Salindor, stay as Implementor
And as player of Fate of kingdom you just simply have to accept it.
 
If your going to accuse Zalev and Salindor of any thing at all you need to 
write clear and give i can look for, i don't care if think they do a bad job 
on less you can give me examples of they do wrong. Send to me in an email.
 
Why Administrators can see IP addresses is so see keep track who is who
if you don't like we can see it find and other mud to play, this will NOT be changed
 
Whining and accusing the staff will only result in they quit being administrators
if both Zalev and Salindor quit i will shutdown Fate of kingdoms.
 
Accusing administrators and Implementors is always a bad idea on you concert things 
Favoring mortals and aid your irl friends wrong and can where and when i will look in to it  
Sadly i my self way to often accused favoring my irl friends and others i did like
in case you don't know i didn't i even more hard to them when they did do something wrong
 
Be nice to the staff here, we do not do this be curse we power we do make the game run
Be nice to the staff here, we do not do this be curse we like power we do make the game run
whining make me really dislike to do something for you and the be nice to others
 
Follow rules and talk nice is all i would like you to do.

Subject Encouragement from Salindor~
Text
Just to keep you guys in the loop, I have begun my analysis of all
the various classes.  The first step in my analysis is simply to map
out what classes have what skills and at what levels.  
 
So far I have maped out 5 of the 18 classes.  Once I have all the skills
mapped out, then I will go back and begin assessing each skill individually.
 
Anyways, just wanted to let you know, that even though your not seeing
anything new code wise; mandatory prework is being done behinde the scenes.
