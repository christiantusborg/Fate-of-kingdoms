Subject ideas~
Text
I am going to try and sum up several of my ideas I have
had over the years:
 
Make it so trains determine groups of skills, which
   determine class.  Class would provide bonuses,
   determine hp,mp,and mv gains.  To encourage classes
   to remain pure, a level 40 and level 80 skill will
   be added that can only be obtained by purebreeds.
 
Create an army system which would be used for town 
   takeover.  This is a rather large endevour as it
   would basically be a game within a game.
 
Add enough skills to each class to ensure there is
   some kind of skill or ability or improvent every
   other level.
 
Balance the game first for pvp, then balance for pve.
 
Change the class names of current classes to 'ancient
<x>' where <x> is the class name for example cleric
would become ancient cleric.  This way once everything
is ready, we make it so the 'ancient' classes are no
longer accessiable.  Then we don't need todo a pwipe
to get the same effect.
 
Make it so during war between kingdoms attacks must
be pre-annouced and the defending side must be allowed
to have half their members on (if the kingdom is in an
alliance, half the members of all alliance members).
 
Make an exception to the previous to allow for alliance
kingdoms to backstab; counter cowardly kingdoms; and
if the other kingdom already meets the prereq for an
attack.
 
twik all the races stat adjustments so they are all even.
 
add a field to areas so we can keep notes in area files
as to past events.  This may help in future quests.
 
Make so every weapon type has skills which only work for 
that weapon.
 
Make it so that any decent skill has a paper/rock/scissors
approach.
 
I am sure I have more, but this note is getting long.

Advertising is gonna be the single best thing we could probably do.
Our pbase has always been the issue and an updated website with
a myspace account would definetly be helpful. I honestly do'nt 
know when the last time I was on mudconnect but as I recall
even when I did check it we where never high on the rankings. 
 
If there is anything i can do i suppose let me know, and umm HI 
by the way hopefully i'll getta see you bums around.

Subject Forum topic~

Here's an idea for a board on the forum -- it's not exactly
an RP-specific board, but more like a place to post old
stories, memories, logs, etc. etc.  Call it "Tales" or
something.

I think we need to log all chat for at least a 48 hr period.

Subject RE: Yuri~

Right now I personally dont see any use for builders
except for them to go through and fix the gear and the mobs
there after.  If we are going to implementing a new
world map and such as Bael suggested then we dont currentlyt
need any new areas.  That is my opinion which is open to
suggestion.  Let me know.

Subject izuzu's rp~
Text
At first when izuzu first presented his rp, I didn't have
a problem with.  The problem came when he decided that he
would be the master assassin in his background.  When I 
critiqued it he just quit.  After his fit he through later
I have decided that his rp is illegal and anything he does
by it should be treated as such.
 
If you have a problem with this, come talk to me.
