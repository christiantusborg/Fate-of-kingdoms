A harmless rat~
A small, harmless rat is climbing among the boxes, looking for food.
~
This rat is no larger than your shoe.  It seems some things have
managed to survive in these ruins, although the food is surely
scarce.  It presses on, undeterred by your presence, continuing its
search for food.

Zoryn figure man cloaked~
Ziuss~
A figure in grey cloak and hood, meditating.
~
This figure is not easily idenifiable, he wears a dark grey cloak
and hood that covers most of his body.  There is nothing obscure
about his muscles, though.  Through the cloak you can see the
jaggedness of his muscular back.  A sword lays by his side, gleam-
ing silver in the torch light.  He sits perfectly still, softly
chanting the same set of words.

The corpse of Garinthul~
The rotten body of a human is laying in the corner.
~
His flesh has rotted away in small splotches across
his body, revealing pale white bone beneath. His eyes
are gone, only sunken black holes remain. A small strap
of leather is wrapped around his waist, with a small satchel
tied to it. It looks as if he has been here an extended period
of time...

guard~
The guild watchman~
A lone guard sits on a stool near the door, obviously not doing his job.
~
This guard wears simple armor, and has a leather sheath at his
waist, holding a dagger.  His hair is of medium length and black, and
mostly concealed beneath his unpolished silver helmet.  His head is
tilted back, resting between the walls at the corner.  His face is
unshaven; everything about this guard is unkempt.  He must not notice
you through his shut eyes as you enter.  At least he doesn't snore.

A rough looking man sleeps, helmet over face, in the corner.

This man has a rough look about him, yet he is not muscular, nor
is he large in size.  He does not snore, and remains almost perfectly
silent.  His faded silver helm is pulled over his eyes, and the only
motions he makes are of his chest raising and falling as he sleeps.

one of those training to slice at him, and he quickly
parries, hoping to demonstrate it to all watching.

A mysterious-looking elf woman sits solemnly on the cot.
~
This woman shocks you with her remarkable beauty.
The clothes she wears are all very intricately
sewn, including the long, faded green dress that
covers most of her body. On her wrists are silver
gauntlets that consist of thick strands of silver
that run around her hands. All of the strands meet
on the tops of her hands, where medium-sized ametheist
stones are set into the silver. Her hair is almost to
her waist, and is brown in color, as are her eyes.
A long amulet hangs from her neck, and it symbol
implies her to be a magister of some kind.
She must be being held here by the mercenaries of
the Shadow Clan.

This painting depicts a city, constructed using many unfamiliar
materials.  Large buildings rise up high toward the sky, thousands of
panes of glass lining their sides.  The sun is shown setting on the
paragon horizon, far to the left of the city.  This causes the glass
to explode in showers of prismatic light, reds and oranges dominating
them all.  The buildings become more and more sparse as the painting
spans further away from the center structures, and the buildings also
decrease in size as you go.  All about the city, twelve of them in
all, are structures that are tremendous in size.  What they lack in
height, they make up for in sheer area.  All sorts of unfamiliar
objects, also large in size, are attached to these buildings; roofs
and sides both contain an equal share of them.  Something truly
disasterous must have happened for all of this to have been...  Laid
to waste like it is.

Here's the deal: I realize none of you people who call yourselves
"Roleplayers" actually read room descriptions.  Therefore, I have
placed many VERY powerful aggie mobs in random places, and the only
clue to the locations of said mobs is in the room descs.  Oh, and I
put some very nice eq in this area, but they can only be gotten, in
part, through quest-type searching.  That's right, that means reading
the room descs to decide where you need to go to find stuff.  I do
this out of selfishness: I think that if I'm going to put 600 hours
into this area, I damn well am going to make sure people read it.

arm is stretched out, his hand pointing ahead of him.  His mount has
been carved in the open position, as if he was speaking.  The podium
the statue rests upon has been budged slightly from where it
originally sat, making a narrow slit between the floor and podium,
only a few inches wide, and colored by sheer darkness.  A draft can
be felt coming from the dark slit in the floor, indicating that a

This painting has a very dark overtone to it.  It depicts a small
group of strangely clothed humans inside a small boat, trying to
cross a river.  It is night time, the cloudly are unfurling across
the sky large and black, and strong rain pours across everything. 
One human in particular stands at the helm of the boat, holding an
odd brightly colored flag in one hand, pointing to the other side of
the river with the other.  A small gold plaque at the bottom appears
to say something about the painting, but it is too corroded from age

Progress is being made, but frankly James, I'm sceptic...
All our experiments thusfar have reaped little, and the
morale of all within the company is dropping. The results
of experiment #872 have surely reached you by now, along
with the news of 6 months of work wasted.
 
 
The head of R&D, a scientist by the name Alan West, seems
to think that he has already discovered our problem to lie
in the way the uracil is matching up with adenine in the
dihybrids we produced. Based on the information he provided
me with, I see no choice but to investigate it further. I'll
try to keep you posted on results ahead of time.

Time has caused this particular page to rot almost
beyond the point of being legible. Several small holes
pockmark the page, similar to the ones that result from
burning pipeweed falling onto an old parchment. It looks

painting~
This painting is very large, as most paintings go.  It stretches
from the rotting baseboard to where the wall and ceiling meet.  It is
coated in a thin layer of dust, like many other things in this
building, but the artwork is still visible.  It shows a relatively
close view of two armies mingled among each other.  Some of the men
are dressed more formal, adorned in bright red with white trim, all
carrying brown staffs with blades built into the end.  The other
group of men is dressed in commoners clothes, most of them in rags,
wielding weapons of all sorts from pitchforks to hand axes.  It seems
that thick fog, or maybe numerous plumes of smoke, float all about
the two groups of men, limiting the visibility of the ones in the
distance.  The painting doesn't seem completely flush with the wall
on its right side, however, leaving a crack small enough to fit the
blade of a thin knife into it.

In The Sewers~
It is now very dark, the only light source comes from a crack
underneath the door you came from, and it limits your sigh sig-
nificantly. You do, however, notice a very strong stench, what is
probably a mold or mildew of some kind, so powerful you can al-
most taste it as you breathe the stale air. While you stand on a 
hard surface of stone, all about you can be heard subtle drippings
and splashings of water, whose noises carry a long reverberated 
echo. The sounds seem to come from the north.

In The Sewers~
The darkness has let up a bit, leaving a twilight amount of
luminescence, but the smell remains. You no longer stand on
hard stone, but in half a fathom of smelly, dank water. Very
faintly, you hear a continous, echoing roar, from up ahead
of you. Also to your north, there are very small flickers of
light. Perhaps they are from torches, or even from the sun...

Back of the Abandoned Building~
The path between the boxes opens up, leaving a large area toward
the back of this warehouse.  Bare, reinforced cement walls are the
only thing decorating the air here, coated with the usual thick
lining of dust.  Against the north wall, a poured cement stairwell
leads down to the basement level of this warehouse; the handrail used
once as a safety measure looks so rusted that the next breath of wind
could knock it from its place.

Inside the Abandoned Warehouse~
The view has not changed now that you have stepped inside.  A
thick layer of dust covers everything in sight, but that doesn't stop
the hollow echoes of your footsteps from bouncing back to you as you
tread through here.  Large crates, still intact and closed, are
stacked clear to the ceiling of this massive structure, on both sides
of you, The boxes were stack in such a way that there is a path
through them, leading you toward the back of this warehouse.  Perhaps
there is a water leak somewhere inside here, because the smell of
mold is very strong now that you are away from exposed air.  It is
also very humid inside, making the air feel damp against your skin.

In View of Bright Lights~
The luminosity has increased still more, and a faint
shadow of your body flickers across the stone-pieced
tunnel you stand in. There is a small amount of force 
pushing at your feet from the water you stand in. As
you look ahead you see why. You realize you are standing
near the mouth of the tunnel, and ahead is a massive 
opening, where the water inside the tunnel flows out from.
You can continue still farther north towards the mouth of
the sewer.

Mouth of the Tunnel~
What you see now amazed you. You now stand in the mouth
of the tunnel, which ends in a truly massive vertical
column. Rings of torches line the interior of this column
about every 10 paces up to the unseen ceiling, and all the
way down to the bottom. There appear to be other tunnels,
like the one you stand in now, throughout the column at
various intervals, and on all sides. They are all gushing
water out of them, like small waterfalls, all the way to
the bottom. It looks to be no less than 100 paces to the
bottom of this massive room. A stone lip extends from the
side of the column by about 3 paces, making it possible to
traverse, if you are careful. The stone lip begins at your
right and left. Also, you notice the beginning of a ladder
fixed at the bottom of the tunnel, leading down toward the bottom
of the column. It's certainly difficult to keep your footing,
with the force of the flowing water is pressing still 
harder at your heels.

After the long climb down the ladder, you have found yourself

halfway between two of the cascading streams of foul water 
which roar from above you, all the way down into a large dark
pool of water in front of you. You can continue east or west,
if you avoid the torrents of water that come from above.

Southwest on a Stone Lip~
You have carefully stepped across to the southwest section
of this column. Lichen and moss have painted abstract pictures
on the stones of the inside wall in shades of green and black.
It would be easy to suffer from vertigo up here. You stand 
precariously on the lip, and looking over it, you see a long 
fall awaiting you should you happen to lose your footing. You
can continue to follow the long curve of the lip to your north,
or you can climb down the ladder that sits at your feet.

likely find a way in, if you looked hard enough...

A Small Alcove~
You breathe a sigh of relief, being off the stone lip and
onto the security that solid ground has to offer. You now stand
with a small stone alcove, the ceiling of which almost touches 
your head as you stand under it. It is certainly hard to see from
the lip, and though it is constructed of the moss-covered stones,
something seems... different. There is a large discoloration in
the stonework before you. Also, the stones there seem not to
be covered in any sort of moss or lichen...

A Hidden Room Behind the Alcove~
You step through the opening in the wall, and find yourself
in a small room with no exits save the one you came in. The 
north wall of the room has three torches burning, and the 
floor below it is covered with a large cloth or blanket. Strange
tools, or perhaps weapons, the likes of which you do not recognize,
are spread out amongst it. You suddenly notice a figure, in grey
cloak and hood, sitting next to them, his back to you.

A Small Cave~
It is rather dark in here, but by the light from the torches
of the columns, you can see that you are in a small cave. Several
stone tools lay near the wall to your right. Likely the stone here
was used to make repairs in the column. The cave continues to your
south.

Back of the Cave~
It is darker still here, as you tread farther from the light of
the column. Several markings decorate the walls of the cave here,
and many of them must be very old, for they are eroded almost
beyond recognition. One of the etchings, written in the modern
toungue, catches your eye. It reads, "Garinthul, humble servant
of Sierus and master alchemist of the known Thera, have come to
what seems is the end. This is at last end of my days, for its
power has grown too strong for me. I feel myself changing... 
fading... I only pray that whoever may find this flee from this
place, before the power of either it or the one who holds
it should find its way to you..."
It seems Garinthul didn't live to finish much more. There are 
markings on the floor, in the shape of two rings, one inside the
other. There is a large diamond placed inside the inner ring. Also,
you notice, there is a symbol that matches it on the ceiling...

Inside the Blocked Tunnel~
Crawling through the narrow opening of the cave ceiling brings
you into the tunnel that you previously could not enter. The same
blockage of stones covers the mouth of the tunnel, behind you. 
Ahead of you a single torch burns softly on the wall, threatening
to go out any moment. Below the torch, only half a pace from the
floor, are 4 carvings, of what seems is a progressive event.
The first shows a human, with a diamond shaped stone above its
head. The second shows surges of lightning or some other type
of energy running from the stone to the human. The third depicts
the human, laying on the ground, presumably dead, with the stone
in the air above its body. The last illustrates the human as a
skeleton, rays of energy coming from its animated body. Strangely,
the last carving lacks the presence of the stone shown in the first
three. This tunnel continues, taking a sharp turn to your east.

End of the Tunnel~
You are at the end of this tunnel. The tunnel ends in a small
room with cave-like features. Toward the back of this room is a 
ladder leading farther into the earth. Laying upon the floor in
the back corner is a skeleton, almost surely of human origin. 
Clutched in its skeletal hand is a small bag. Laying near it
legs is a chisel. Perhaps this is what remains of Garinthul...

Beneath the Tunnel~
It is shockingly brighter down here. Torches line the wall
every few paces, illuminating your surroundings amazingly well.
Unfortunately, there isn't much to see. The ground is hard
clay, and the walls seem comprised of a mix of gravel and
dirt. There are two passageways leading both to your north,
and to your east. There is a wooden sign crookedly stuck
into the clay at the corner of this intersection.

Thom's Bazaar~
There is a counter here, which Thom stands behind, and
it seems to be carved from only one piece of stone. It 
extends a considerable distance to your west, where another
figure awaits behind a counter. Several objects and oddities
line the wall behind Thom, and the shelves above him hold
everything from arrows to casks of water. Thom stares at
you, and looks as if he doesn't care who you are, as long
as you buy something.

Murvin's Enigmas~
The view has certainly changed as you come to this half of the
counter.  Against the wall behind Murvin are several different
colored staffs, and the shelf above them holds many small vials, the
contents of which vary in color.  Many rolled up parchments lay
stacked one upon the other, and wands are hovering by some unseen
magic off in a corner of the shelf.  Murvin himself sits on a raised
chair, legs folded and eyes shut.  He does not make a sound, nor does
he move.  Perhaps you should just buy something and leave.

A Dark Clay Tunnel~
Heading east at the intersection brings you further down
the clay tunnel. The clay looks darker here, however, and
instead of the normal brown the clay is almost black, as if
from contamination. Even the torches on the walls here seem
to burn a darker red. This tunnel continues to your east, or
west back to the intersection.

Among Ancient Stones~
The clay of the walls is thinning out here, but many
stones, which appear almost as old as Thera itself, 
have created the walls here. Where you stand the walls
are infused with both a dark clay and these archaic stones.
Ahead you, to your north, there is a room, and it also seems
completely comprised of these same stones.

A Degraded Stone Room~
Now at the end of the passage, you are in a room
made entirely of ancient stones stacked upon each
other. The room is not terribly large, but its size would
allow it to easily house one hundred people. There are
eight cots in this room, four along the wall both on your
left and right. There is a certain morbid feel to this room,
perhaps it comes from the blood stains on the sheets of the
cots, or from the crude looking tools hanging from the wall up
ahead of you. There is an exhasted looking orc posted on a
stool in the back corner of the room, near all of the hanging
tools. You can rest here among the spots of blood, or head
back the way you came.

Guard Room~
You are now in a small room.  The walls are constructed
of old mason stones, and sand has leaked through some
seams in the stones. There is only one other door in this
room, to your north, and a rather stern-looking guard stands
next to it. There is also a door to your south, which you came
through. Two torches, one on either side of your, burn brightly,
casting your shadow against the wall, and they flicker from the
air that is pushed through from under the door.

Entrance Room~
The view remains much the same here.  The smell of wet limestone
pervades the hallways, as drops of water fall in random locations
from the ceiling above to splash on the wet stone floors.  Torches
held by blackened metal brackets are fastened to the walls, providing
large amounts of light for all surrounding areas.  The passage
stretched north for a ways before dividing, up ahead.

Before an Old Warehouse~
The small path has come to an end now as well, leaving you before
a large old building.  There are holes in the front, as tall and wide
as a grown troll, where glass windows must have once been.  The walls
seem made of poured and reinforced concrete, which would explain why
this building still stands.  The dimensions of this building are
quite large, however, and they exceed even the largest of homes in
Elvandar.  The front doors of this building are made of a faded,
corroded metal, and could be rusted shut.  The entrance to this
building is to your north.

A Cramped Back Alley~
You stand in between the ruins of the buildings, in what seems to
be the remnants of a small alley.  Small plants certainly seem to
flourish here, growing up from between the numerous cracks in the
road.  An erie silence pervades this small area, and an uncomfortable
feeling comes over your body.  The small passage between the
buildings ends here, but a thin sidewalk past the last building will
take you east.

Behind the Rubble~
Rolling the boulder out of the way has allowed you safe
passage to the other side. There are large but crumbling
buildings to your north and east, blocking off any means
of travel in those directions. You stand in between the ruins
of the buildings, in what seems to be the remnants of a small
alley. Small plants certainly seem to flourish here, growing
up from between the numerous cracks in the road. An erie
silence pervades this small area, and an uncomfortable feeling

Capital Square~
The stacks of ravaged buildings disperse to the north, stacking
themselves into chaotic rows but still allowing for a thin lane to
stretch north for an acre or more.  To the south, a large white
building, most of it colored a faded grey by smoke, rests silently,
though much of it lies in piles near the ground in the form of old
debris.  The path that follows this large building continues back
around it in both the east and the western directions.

The view of the large building just a few paces southeast of here
begins to change, gradually, as progression is made in either
direction.  A broader spectrum of the substantial damage given to the
building is far more noticable now: small piles of debris that have
surprisingly not blown away are seen outskirting the house, and
numberous holes can be spotted pockmarking the entire surface of the
house.  Every window that once graced any side of the house with its
spacious view has been shattered, along with the lives of many from
the surrounding buildings.  Several marks about the house indicate
fire was prevelant throughout the entire area at one time, but there
is little evidence to support the idea.

Before a Massive Building~
This building is larger than the ones to the south, being that
it is was the center for all operations involing the adjacent
buildings. It is still very much intact, only parts of the walls
are missing. The door, though intact, is cracked, implying an
easy entry. There is struggling vegetation in pockmarks throughout
the front lawn of this building, though they are all brown from the
decay surrounding them, or from a hot flame. The road curves around
this building, both to the east and west.

Entrance to the Capitol Building~
The interior of this building is, surprisingly enough, mostly
intact.  There seems to be a little bit of damage to different areas
of the walls, but they are small enough that most people wouldn't
notice them.  There are only walls to your left and right, and in
front of you the room opens up into the main area of the statehouse. 
Where you stand now is still in excellent condition, almost as if
someone still lived here.  The ceiling stretches upward for at least
twenty paces, and it is painted a regal shade of white.  There is a
painting to your left, which shows what looks to be a city.

Edge of the District~
Strangely enough, many of the buildings here look the same.  All
of them, within a hundred paces in any direction, are made of the
same concrete reinforement.  They all retain the same dull grey
luster, and all of them are two floors in height.  Most of these
buildings were used toward a single purpose, that of assisting the
main office.  That building appears to be north, past the glistening
shards of broken glass that litter the roadway.

By Crumbling Buildings~
Now within the outermost edge of the inner city, the force of the
wind has died altogether.  The sound of it can still be heard, yet it
is quieting itself, being replaced by the awkward silence here, such
as the silence experienced just before a torrential storm.  What were
once street lights are now mangled, rusty old rods bent over in
awkward positions and laying in the remnants of the street.  They
have been so heavily corroded that their permanent color is now a
deep brown, and small piles of collected rust lie about their bases. 
The structures here are incredible, as large as the High Tower of
Mages, and yet as sturdy as the tree of pixies, for they have stood
for countless aeons.  To the north more buildings can be seen, and
one in particular that looks as though it holds higher importance
than the others.

Edge of the Ruined City~
The slope is, and has been for fair distance, sloped downhill. 
This downhill slope occurs all about the city, with the city itself
being at the center of the slope.  Large amounts of stone and twisted
iron make heaps here, no more than 300 paces from the first of the
towering, degraded buildings.  Dull brown and white glints emanate
from all about the ground, as the struggling rays of sunlight reflect
off the thousands of pieces of glass that lay in shattered pieces
near the structures.  The strength of the wind has decreased here,
likely due to the shelter that the buildings can offer, despite their
condition.  A cluster of fairly large buildings looms to the east,
with a small, dilapidated roadway leading in between them.

Narrow Passage Between Buildings~
The passage between these buildings acts as a wind tunnel, allow a
free flow of air from the outside.  The wind whistles loudly as it
passes through here, blowing debris past at high speeds, and keeping
the temperature at a permanent low in comparison with elsewhere. 
This, combined with the shadows from the buildings, and the cloud
cover, makes for a very uncomfortable environment.

Narrow Passage Between Buildings~
The broken down old road ends here, as the asphalt slowly turns
into dirt and nearly dead grass, which in turn ends in another
building directly east.  However, it seems that there is a gap
between the building east of here and the one north of here; the
corners of the two do not quite touch, leaving a moderate sized gap
between them.  Otherwise, there is no way out, save west.

Open Area Within the Buildings~
The light has dimished a small amount, due to the fact the walls
of two buildings, one on either side, rise up floors and floors from
here.  The wind is not as strong here, the archaic walls of the
buildings protect you from its intensity.  North, the passage seems
to stop blocked by a very old, very rotted, wooden fence.  It looks
at though it was not even fastened, simple placed there as a feeble
attempt to direct individuals elsewhere.  Even a pixie would possess
the strength to move it.

Before the Monument~
Due to the fact that it rests between this cluster of buildings,
this monument has likely gone unseen for countless years.  It looks
as though it is incomplete, but at once was truly massive in size.  A
large podium, square in shape, sits amidst the old, cracked dirt,
resting on a flat of cement, which itself is in the shape of a star. 
The podium for this monument holds an entirely unrecognizable figure,
which is about half missing.  The figure ends at about its waist,
where jagged and blackened shards of metal juts upwards towards the
sky.  The remaining part of the figure, in entirety, has been colored
a very faded green color, from oxidation of the metal to the air, and
many spots across it are darkened, undoubtedly from the same flames
that darkened the other buildings.

Among the Wreckage~
The crumbling wreckage grows ever closer.  There is a peculiar
smell in the air, and it grows colder here as more and more cloud
cover looms over this forgotten wreckage.  Reinforced concrete seems
to be what has allowed the remaining structures to stand for so long,
but from their age and decay, could fall in any minute.  Several of
the smaller buildings in this area have blackened marks on them, as
if they were exposed to a very hot flame.  Though there is no flame
nor smoldering piles of ruins, undoubtedly there was at one time, for
the destruction still remains.  Between two of the smaller buildings
to the left there seems an opening large enough to walk through, the
end of which cannot be seen as it is consumed by the dark shadows of
the buildings around it.

Blocked by Rubble~
The travel between the buildings seems to have yielded no
plausible results.  Passage between these two buildings may have been
possible at one point, but no longer is, for tremendous piles of
stone debris blocks it entirely.  The air feels stagnant and moist,
as if the air between these buildings is coming from another, more
moist, source...

The pitiable destruction grows more intense here.  To the left, a
tall building, the height of 5 giants, stands, most of its walls
missing, revealing the rotted innards of it.  A sign to right, also
large in size, and intact due to its metallic composition, has a
faint inscription on it, each of the letters the size of a human:

In View of Destruction~
Complete and utter desolation.  These are the best words, really
the only words, to aptly describe the view here.  The sunlight does
not reach these lands with its full intensity, there seems to be a
thick hazy halo in the air about it.  Many buildings lay about the
land, destroyed, dormant, with rubble all about them.  The terrain,
the ruined structures, all seem to have the same faded brown color. 
A few rays of sunlight seem to manage to pierce through the thick
gloom, giving enough light to prove that the sun is in fact there,
but the environment is still very gloomy.  Many tall structures
stand, erratically placed about the area, shining in different and
awkward places from the struggling sunbeams, though there is little
reflection for most of the glass of the buildings has been shattered
over time.  Besides the faint white glint that the buildings provide,
there seems no life to this place at all.  It is entirely silent,
save for the wind, which seems to rip through the earth itself with
its occasional intensity and volume.  Some sort of awful disaster
must have occurred for a city of this magnitude to have been laid to
waste as it was...

Inside the Capitol Building~
Now against the west wall, lined with broken windows, a fair draft
can be felt.  Being that the windows are broken on either side of
this building, the wind can pass freely through as it picks up or
decreases.  There are many chairs in this section of the spacious
room, all of them turned over and laying in chaotic patterns across
the floor. The walls are barren here, though several walls decors are
laying scattered at the baseboard of the room, all covered in a thin
white dust, the dust the ceiling gave when struck from the impact.

Since the entirety of this massive room is domed in shape, the
statue east of here would succeed in grabbing nearly anyone's
attention even in the ambient light from the broken windows.  Few
things are different in this area of the room; the paintings adorning
the baseboard are gone, for in fact, the baseboard itself is gone. 
Where the baseboard would have been, west, there is a large passage,
the height of which climbs to the ceiling.  A flight of stairs
appears to be at the end of that passage.

walls.  It still holds the dried and brittle remnants of tree roots,
from a small tree that once grew within it.

There are two very decorative golden statues on either side of the
door that is, suprisingly enough, still intact despite its wooden
composition.  The statues both depict a large, intricately featured
birds, likely now extinct due to the time lapse.  They too have lost
their golden luster, and now look as dull as a gold coin.  The door
north looks as though it might still open.

This corner of the building contains several filing cabinets, once
white in color but mostly brown from age and decay from rust.  The
cabinets rest against the right side of the corner, and a dark
colored wooden desk rests against the wall ahead.  Several splotches
of the word are very dark in color, likely from years of exposure to
the rain.  The large window behind the desk, which is almost entirely
broken, is likely to blame for this.  To the west a large painting
can be seen on the wall, placed where another window might have been.

The draft is felt equally on this side of the building.  Though it
is only one room, it is a large room, and this allows large amounts
of wind to sweep through the shattered windows, blowing occasional
amounts of dust into the air.  Any light that comes in between the
seldom breaks in the cloud cover reflects off the dust particles,
giving the room a very gloomy appearance.  There are a few paintings
laying around, most of them removed from the wall long ago by the
force of the blast, and resting against the baseboard.

Center of the Capitol Building~
There is a faded metal statue in the center of the domed room,
fighting against time and rust.  Once golden in color, it has now
been reduced to a dull, unappealing copper.  Its supports seem to be
very sturdy, strong enough to survive the blasts unphased.  Behind
the statue, a desk can be seen, slowly rotting, and behind that, a
door strong enough to stand despite its level of depravity.  The
statue seems to have slid a small amount from where it originally
stood, and a very soft draft can be felt near the floor.

This old office has little definition about the edges of anything

in the center of the room makes a V shape, the center of it has given
in as the wood slowly rotted away.  There are a few stranglely
coloured posters on the walls, faded by age, that have cryptic
looking language scrawled across them.  A few papers lay scatted
about different places, shockingly they have survived millenia of
aging.

the ceiling so many paces above.  The breeze from your entry shakes a
little bit of dust loose from the dusty chandelier above, making a
small snowstorm of dust particles shower you.  West an ancient statue

towards the center, except for a narrow looking staircase against the
far east wall, leading downward into the dark room below.  A door
stands near this staircase, with a strange sign that reads in red
letters: EXIT.  The sign seems to be made of a strange white
composite material, and has been dyed beige from the time of day when
the sun would shine through the window to stain it.  After further
examination, doors made to look as though they were part of the wall
itself can be dimly seen to both the north and the south.

in the middle of this room, and a strange species of fungus covers a
large percentage of its remnants.  A typewriter, likely once neatly

The fire damage is most significant within this room.  Every wall,
every surface of the room, has been adorned with black flame marks. 
Wavy streaks of black start near the floor the color of pitch, and
stretch upwards towards the ceiling slowing changing in color to the
color of oakwood.  A few more filing cabinets are in this room, in a
line at the back of the room, but they have been completely destroyed
by the fires that once raged within the room.  The drawers of the
file cabinets have melted some around their edges, permanently
sealing off the destroyed documents that might remain inside.  Very
small puddles of metal sit near the corners of the cabinets, on the
floors, implying the immense heat of the fires that burnt this room.

white and all else nearby dark shades of smoke.  The northern wall is

whistles from the outside to inside through it.  A single cabinet has

though it can hardly be called art anymore.  The fire has melted much
of the canvas, and the frame has only survived because of its metal
composition.  Drips of paint melted off the surface of the canvas

of paint chips have been collecting on the floor.  A strong breeze
can be felt blowing through here, tossing dust and paint chips into
the air, and a dull and constant roar comes from the west.

View of the City~
This section of the statehouse has been completely destroyed.  The
only remnants of it are the floor, which looks to crumble more and
more with every passing day.  A powerful breeze blows past the
opening in the building, making a lowpitched whistle.  Black scorch
marks line the edges of where destroyed wall and air meet, and small
piles of rubble sit on the floor nearby.  The view from here is
shocking-there seems to be nothing left of this city.  The only
buildings left entirely standing seem to be far off to the north. 
Near that area, there are a total of 3 buildings, two of them 3
floors high, the other one only two floors high.  All, however, are
great in size, and even from this distance the scorch marks are
evident across most of the surfaces of the buildings.  However, they
still still stand, regardless.

The stones of the hallway before are now gone, replaced by
stronger, more solid, rock that now lines the walls, floors, and
ceilings of this passage.  West is a what looks to be a small alcove
into the rock, perhaps some sort of room devoted to storage.

A Storage Room~
This room seems to serve litle purpse, save to hold several crates
and the miscallaneous items inside them for later use.  A ring of
torches hangs from a metal chandelier, illuminating the room.  A few
of the crates have been left open, their contents exposed for easy
takings, thought what is inside the crates remains a mystery.

ceilings, however, have disappeared, and cool dry stone walls create
this passage.

The passage splits here to create a T.  There are no clues to hint
at what might lie to the west or east, however faint sounds can be
heard emanating from both directions.  The sounds are similiar to
that of the clang of sword striking sword.  Against the wall ahead is
another stack of boxes.  The residents of this place seem to hoard
great quantities of items...

This hallway looks somehow...  Newer, than the main passage.  The
limestone that makes the hallway looks to be a brighter shade,
implying it has been exposed to the elements for less time.  The
brackets holding torches are not black, but a dull silver, implying
they are newer as well.  The clanging sounds are growing louder
during the travel down this hallway.

The strange smell of wet sand pervades this region of the hallway,
due to the wet nature of the limestone walls.  The air is cool, but
great amounts of moisture still float in the air about the hallway. 
Farther east a bend can be seen in the hallway.

a four way intersection, with torches planted on the corners, in
lacquer covered bamboo poles, to prevent the fires from spreading.

in several different piles, full bags of unknown items sit near the

middle of the room as well, holding a sleeping, but nonetheless rough
looking, man.  To the right is the smaller passage, and farther still
in that direction is what looks to be another room, like this one.

the torches are burnt brighter there for a reason.

and yells, a good implication that he did something incorrectly.

Blocked By Rubble~
The passage ends abrubtly here, and the tunnel is confronted with
a large wall of rubble.  Some time ago the ceiling of this section of
tunnel became too weak and the stress brought all the the stone from
above to a crash here.  The limestone rocks that make up the rubble
are all covered by slime that gleams in the torchlight, and still
others are covered by blankets of vibrant green moss.  The only
option is back east.

flicker from the displaced air of your entry, and no breeze can be
felt through these halls at all.  Droplets of water can be heard

A Side Passage~
This side passage is thinner than the main passage that leads
through the underground.  The torches occur much more seldom here,
being placed on once about every ten paces along the walls.  Between
the constant drips of water from the ceiling, the moist air, and the
dim light, it makes for a very dark atmosphere.

seems to leak water water out of imaginary seams, and drops trickle
down the limestone wall, though it seems a bit offset from the rest
of the wall.

Intersection of Passages~
Several different passages interchange here, in all cardinal
directions.  East and north the passage remains uniform in size, and
to the south the passage grows a little smaller.  Occasional clanking
noises reverberate by, emanating from the east and north.

This hallway is much shorter, being only about twenty paces in
length from where you stand to the opposite end.  The flicker of
brighter torchlight can be seen up ahead, flickering against the
walls, and clangs that sound as if they come from swords echo from up
ahead.

A Storage Room~
The room is not very well-lit, the only source of light in the
room comes from a lone torch posted in the center of the room.  The
torch rests within a small iron stand, melded together with other
pieces to resemble a large sword, the hilt of which makes the torch. 
The room is filled with very few belongings, just large piles of
burlap sacks in the far corner, and a small wooden weapons rack
against the closest wall.  This room seems to be used for nothing
more than storage.
