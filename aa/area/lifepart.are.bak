of a hyena.  It's skin is a greenish grey, which gets darker near the
snout.  Along it's head and neck the mane is a dull yellowish color. 
It's entire body is covered with randomly arranged greenish circles
and spots, like a hyena.  Looking around the room, it cackles loudly.

black tongue.

A witch~
A hunched over old woman huddles here next to the fireplace.
~
This witch is utterly hideous.  Long, thin, greasy black hair
dangles down her back.  Her skin is pale and almost translucent.  Her
light green eyes have sunken deep into her skull, almost as if they
were hiding.  She is severely hunched over and appears as if she's
almost 90 human years old.  Long black nails have grown from her
fingers over the years.  Her skin is stretched very tightly over her
fragile bones.  However, there is an aura about her that is very
strange.  A sense of fear developes, as she starts to mutter in a
strange language to herself.  She grins at nothing, bearing her three
yellow teeth.  Her garb is nothing more than a black tattered robe
that hangs loosely to her body.

You stand at the entrace of the tower.  From everywhere you hear
sounds of incantations.  Somewhere along the lines you think you
might have heard someone talking to a demon or another darkspawn. 
There is also a sign at the door, upon closer inspection it reads:
Welcome to the tower, only mages are allowed here, uninvited will be
the target of our experiments.

Chapel Entrance~
This is the entrace to the Zirnex Chapel.  There are large doors
made up of solid oak wood bound together by broad iron clasps.  Ivy
wildy pressed flat against the stone wall reaches the top of the
Chapel.  Atop the chapel a huge tattered iron cross stands dull and
sturdy.  The cross had once been painted black yet the paint has wore
away so much that it's true color shows through.  North past the
doors leads into the Zirnex Chapel.

This particular room was made for the common man, as you can tell
by the lack of money put into the furniture.  The tables have no
sheets to cover them, the candles themselves sit in the middle of the
table and make leave wax everywhere.  The floor is very dirty and
covered in rotten food and spilled ale.  The waiters are little human
boys, barely able to keep your order straight.

the cooks prepare some of the most tasty looking food you have ever
layed your eyes on.  You'd best leave quickly, or the cook may make
you wash the dishes.

order to keep the food and drink from going to waste.  The stone
walls are lined with shelves upon shelves full of all sorts of Ale
and Mead.  Strong, wooden boxes are piled in the corner and seem to
be packed full of numerous different types of food.

relaxing within.  A pretty young lady sits calmly behind a window
waiting to help a customer find a room.

of numerous beautiful sights throughout Thera.  One shows blue water
cascading down a waterfall, another shows a stary night as soon from
Mount Kintane, and yet another depicts the city of Sanaria from afar.

iron stairs spiral upwards to the second floor bedrooms.  The hand
rail is made of gleaming silver.  At bottom and top of the of the
hand rail are silver lions hands, used to help the feeble onto the
first stair.  They glare around the room and seem to be watching
everything.  There is a carpet on the floor that seems to be covering
something and there is also a door to your right.

An old, worn hallway~
This hallway is very old, as you can tell from the torn wallpaper
and cobwebs that cover the ceiling.  It hasn't been repaired for
quite some time, not that it really matters.  The rug that once
covered the floor is now torn to shreds and needs to be thrown out. 
North of here the horses can be heard stamping about their stalls,
along with the barking of an occasional dog.

everywhere, and the stench of large animals is all about you.  Above
the door the words "Stable" are carved.  Over the years, it appears
that age has gotten the best of the stable.  Everything looks like it

from here and there, trying to feed or clean up after the animals. 
The horses looks inquisitively at you from all of the stables around
you.  Bails of hay and straw are everywhere, along with mud and
filth.

A Stable~
Straw covers the floor of these old wooden stables.  The smell of
horses and numerous other animals lingers in the air.  Boards on the
walls seem to be broken from angry horses.  Dung covers the one
corner, and in general this is just not a nice place to be.  Perhaps
if you are truely starving, you could eat the food laying here...  If
you dare.

one.  The wood creaks loudly as you walk up it, waking up all the
guests on the second floor.  There are no pictures here, just bare

Troll Lair.~
{DNarrow windy Tunnels leads around in this naturally formed
cavern.  There are large footprints in the dirt.  Lots of boulder are
strewn around everywhere...  Old bones are collecting dust along the

bench.  A few sharp edges on the cave walls can be seen and there are
no signs of craftsmanship done anywhere in the rooms of this cavern.

Climbing from the Ship's Mast~
A strong rope, drops down from the Crow Nest of the ship.  The
ship's sails are all about, hanging from the ship's yard.  Below,
the entire ship can be seen.  Tightly kept, and well scrubbed.  The
yard of the ship is just a bit further up the mast, and the Crow's Nest
lying beyond the yard.

Further up the Ship's Mast~
A strong rope, drops fown from the Crow Nest, not too much farther
up the mast.  The ship's yard, crosses the mast a few arm-lengths up
the mast, with the ship's sails hanging from the yard, engulfing all
directions in white.  The ship's deck rests a short distance below.

The Crosshairs of the Ship's Mast and Yard~
The ship's yard and mast meet here, crossing each other perpendicularly.
The ship's sail hang far below, from the ship's yard.  The Crow Nest is a small
bit further up the mast, accessible thanks to a strong rope hanging from it,
far below to the ship's deck.

The Crow's Nest~
A spectacular view can be seen, in all directions, as far as the eye
can see, to the horizon.  The sky seems so close, that one could reach
out with their hand, and grab at it.  Below, the ship's sails hang from
the yard, in a marvelous manner, stretching out to the ship's deck, which
lies very far below.  A rope hangs from the Crow's Nest, following the mast
down to the ship's deck.

The Yardarm~
The Yardarm, portrudes north and south, from the ship's mast.  A
wise estimate would be, that it stands at least a hundred paces above
the deck of the ship.  The ship's sails, a beautiful white material,
hand-knitted by master tailor's, to ensure it had the greatest of strength,
are tied to the yardarm here with many entricate knots.  The sails
hang down towards the deck of the ship, strapped here and there, to
ensure it catches the greatest amount of wind.  The mast is accessible,
following the yardarm to the south.

The Bridge of the Ship~
Wonderfully hand-carved, well-polished railings surround
what must be the bridge of the ship.  From the Captain's post, an overview
of the entire ship can be had.  With the exception of the ship's stern.  It's
view being blocked by the Captain's Quarters.  The wheel of the ship
stands in the midst of the bridge, seemingly carved with the utmost care, and
perfect precision.  Beautiful hand-crafted stairs to the west, will take you
back to the ship's deck.

The Captain's Quarters~
A low ceiling, gives insult to otherwise, a very cozy and comfortable room.
A large, nicely-kept bed lies in the corner.  The room seems decorated
with items and belongings from many foreign locations.  A bundle of
navigatory maps lay at the foot of the bed, next to the Captain's desk.
A window looks out eastward, over the ship's stern, while a door leads
west back to the ship's bridge.

The Gunnery's Storage Room~
A sulfuric stench haunts this room.  Small burlap sacks resting all about
this small, stench-drenched rooms, give hint to the culprit of the stench.
Gunpowder, and lots of it, is stored within this room, inside the sacks.
A large pile of cannonballs, rests in one corner, some threatening to roll
off the pile and strike something, as the ship sways to and from.  A door
to the east, leads back to the gunnery deck.

and the smell of gunpowder seems horrendously worse, coming from there.
To the north and south, corners of the gunnery deck can be found, beginning
the western line of cannons.  To the east, lies two sets of stairs.  One
leading up to the ship's upperdeck, the other down into the ship's bunker.

Before a grave~
You find yourself standing infront of a very old grave.  All you
can see is a tombstone and some rotted flowers infront of it.  The
ground here is nothing but blight, and as you look over the grave, a
cold wind slowly hits you in the face, you can also hear some
whispers in the air, spooky.

Graveyard Path~
You are moving along the graveyard path.  The air here is very
damp and cold.  The ground here just keeps getting more and more
dead, blighted.  Large iron fences tower to your west and east,
behind them you can see lots of tombstones, and you can barely see
some movement.  You can continue north and south.

Inside an Old House~
You have entered a very old house.  The hinges on the door can
barely hold the rotted wooden door in its place.  Some old wooden
chairs and a small table stand in the middle of the room.  An old
burned-out fireplace is placed in the corner, there is a cauldron in
it.  This looks to be the old home of a Necromancer.

You are in a cross section in the northern part of the graveyard. 
A cold breeze hits you in the face, chilling your bones.  The ground
here seems to have died, there is nothing but blight on the ground. 
Dry ground, sand and dirt, some bugs crawl on the ground.  You can
spot some trees stripped of leaves, swaying on the wind.  You can

stern walls are crafted of stone, and twin reinforced oaken doors
stand slightly open to the north, with wide marble stairs leading up
to them.  The cathedral's walls are quite thick, and this place
appears to be passable both as a place of worship and a
fortification.  Up above, there are a few lofty minarets rising into
the air, and a solid red flag flies from the peak of a tower.  Above
the doors is a large, multi-paned stained glass window.

Tightly fitted stones make up the floor, and it is covered in a thick
red carpeting.  There is scant light, though what there is comes from
torches on the walls.  Spaced at regular intervals are tall
tapestries, each depicting a scene of religioius importance.

small, with barely enough room for the cleaning tools themselves.

line the walls, their portrayal's faces glaring menacingly in the
fickle lamplight.  The halls continue east, south, and west.

The {DM{Win{wis{Wtr{Dy {w of {DT{Wr{wu{Wt{Dh{x~
A constant dripping sound and the lack of much light at all makes
this northeastern corner of the Ministry of Truth's inner sanctum an
uneasy place.  There is carpet covering the floor, and the heavy
stone walls stand, silent and impassive as ever.  Lights hang high
above, from the vaulted chamber celing, and a few cobwebs straggle
down from them.  The exits are west and south.

The {DM{Win{wis{Wtr{Dy {w of {DT{Wr{wu{Wt{Dh{x~
This corner of the chambers of the Ministry of Truth's
inner-sanctum is not well-kept at all, with the carpeting torn and
the only tapestry lying in shreds.  There is an old lamp hanging from
the celing, but it's been broken.  Now the only light comes from a
burning torch hanging from the wall.  The chamber stretches north and
west.

A few cobwebs hang down from the lanterns here, catching the
yellow light with an eerie glow.  All around are tapestries, both on
the far wall and this one.  Tight-fitting flat stones comprise the
floor, and they are covered in a crimson carpet.  From somewhere,
some loud clanging sounds can be heard, along with a steaming hiss.

There is a constant dripping sound coming from one of the slightly
damp stone walls here, indicating that this area may be underground. 
Tapestries hang from the wall, though they are starting to mold a
bit.  The sanitarian doesn't come down here often, if at all.  This
hall stretches north, and east.  There are a few bits of broken stone
and iron lying on the lush crimson carpeting.

The Main Hall continues.  It's thick, fortress-like walls lie
heavily on either side, closing in the structure, even though this
hall is relatively wide.  Tapestries stretch across the stone walls
on both sides, each on depicting a different scene of knights of
valor.  This hall stretches north, and south.

There is a very elaborately wrought archway that spans over the
main hall here.  It is carved of the same stone as the walls, and
shaped into the form of two dragons inter-connected by their necks. 
There are two large torches on either side of it, casting enough
light.  The exits are northward, through the arch, and south.  
There is also a large {cinscription{x written in Common over the arch.

cul de sac, with the stone of the walls covered by a single, long
tapestry.  It depicts a valiant knight on a shining steed, fiery
lance in his hands and a shield of gold on his arm.  To the {Ywest{x
is the Hall of the Keep of Chevaliers, and south is the main hall.

twinkling lanterns hanging down from it.  There is no carpet on this
floor, but it is kept very clean, almost to a polish.  The hall
stretches east, and west there is another archway.

sandy desert~
This part of the desert seems to be less affected by the
devastating sands.  The wind seems to keep to the west.  This is
probably because the walls direct the wind to stay away from what
lies to the east.  To the east is a small area with a door on the
eastern wall.  You can also leave north west and south.

An entrance to a dark swamp~
Up ahead lies a very ancient swamp.  Not much can be seen besides
the foliage on the outter edges, due to the dense fog that sits
within the swamp.  A moldy smell hovers in the air and seems to be
everywhere.  Deep within the sounds of many horrifying creatures can
be heard, bellowing out in anger or pain.  A sign stand here bearing
the message, "Beware Traveller!"

A dimly lit bog~
A putred, moldy smell flows everywhere within this bog.  The
shallow water here is covered with rotten foliage that happened to
fall from the dead trees above.  It's a very dense pool that makes it
severely hard to manuever.  All around the bog are dead trees,
covered in moss and rotting leaves.  To the east lies a foggy path,
to the north there seems to be more swampland.

A thick layer of fog covers the muddy floor of this path.  On
either side of the path are very ancient and dead trees.  They have
grown so close together that there is no seeing what lies past them. 
Branches hang low, reaching to snag and bother whatever or whoever
they can.

branches seem to have stooped even lower here.  A thick almost

Ahead lies a large, yet very muddy pool of water.  It does not
look to be terribly deep, but the amount of filth and algae within it
is sickening to some.  Along the edges of the pond are thick bushes
that lead off to other parts of this strange swamp.  A pile of dirt
seems to have been unearthed in an attempt to go downwards.

The tunnel from the surface has lead downwards into the den of
some kind of creature.  Bones have been piled along the one side of
the room and treasure along the other.  Among the treasure lies a few
weapons and even a piece of treasure.  Peering about the room reveals
that there are no branching tunnels, only this room.  The only light
in here dimly beems down from the entrance.

want nothing more than to put out an eye.  Dirty clings to armor and
even the body along this path, it cannot be helped.

Underneath a bush~
The previous path has lead directly to within a large, dead bush. 
It seems that many of the creatures within this swamp have chosen
this as a place to lay before they passed away, it is very evident
due to the amount of skeletons laying here and there.  The putred
smell of death lies thick and heavy within this brush.  It appears
the only exits are back the other way or northwards through the bush.

A tangled path~
The bush has lead directly into a tangle path of
vines and ivy. The trees have been so overgrown with
the vines that all light has been blocked out. All
life underneath this foliage has been dead for quite
some time. The swamp is more or less a little drier here
compared to the rest of this god forsaken area. Northwards
the path continues.

Along a tangled path~
The path of vines and ivy has seemed to grow thicker in spots and
near the top of the dead trees it has grown thin, allowing light to
pass within to some extent.  The dimly lit path reveals nothing
terribly different from the earlier path.  The swampland here is
still more or less try compared to the entrance.  Light green moss
covers the ground and the trees.  Along the east and west sides of
the many fallen trees, some of which seem to have made some sort of
shelter.

A smelly lair~
The fallen trees here lay in such a way that it has formed a
natural lair and shelter.  There is a slight warmth to this room that
wasn't felt other parts of the swamp.  Covering the floor are piles
upon piles of skeletons.  Some of rats, others from creatures that
look somewhat human.  Beams of light seap through the wholes in the
fallen trunks, and shed a greenish light within the lair.

This pathway through the swamp is a muddy one.  Branches loom
overhead keeping out most of the light.  Moss covers the trees here,
giving the path a dull greenish hue.  The mud is rather thick and
hard to plow through.  Up ahead the pathway looks to end and open up
into the large part of the swamp.

Within the swamp~
Here lies the bulk of the ancient swamp.  As far as can be seen,
there is nothing but marshy swampland.  There are pools of water
here, puddles of mud there, and even a few trees throughout the
swamp.  Considering how few the trees are, the only thing that dims
the light here is the dense fog.  Every now and then, the cry or
bellow of a creature echoes through the swamp.  Ivy and vines dangle
from the trees surrounding the edge of the swamp, seeming to keep
everything inside.  Moss covers whatever hard ground there is and
clings to every available inch of every tree and rock.

A bend through the swamp~
The surrounding trees have fallen in such a way that a corner was
formed here, turning travellers either back to where they came from
or northwards.  Little red beady eyes peer out at you from underneath
the dead trees.  Whispering can be heard, though not understood.  The
mud and water here isn't very thick and is rather easy to move
through.  The smell of a moldy swamp again appears, nearly gagging
even the insects here.

A shaded, dark part of the swamp~
The surrounding trees loom overhead and happen to block out all
light in the particular area of the swamp.  At least in the other
parts, travellers would have an idea of what was around them.  Here,
some things may remain hidden from sight.  It appears that other
travellers may have sunk deep into the mud in the past, their boots
and even some equipment have long since been stuck in this mud. 
Vines here seem to make natural nooses, some of which are the perfect
size ...

the trees and surrounding rocks.  A thick, white fog hangs gently
upon the air, seemingly unmovable by anything.

A series of paths~
Travellers in the path have had a choice here.  Pathways through
the swamp lead northwards and westwards.  The other choice is to go
back into the largest area of the swamp along with the mud and water.
The light shines through here somewhat well for a change.  The weeds
and moss glow brightly in the sunlight.  The rocks glisten with
wetness, and the trees tower higher than ever.

A corner within the swamp~
This corner of the swamp seems to mostly be a large pond of murky
water.  An occasional bubble will rise to the surface and pop
quietly, suggesting that perhaps something is alive down below.  The
only way through this pond is by the natural stepping stones through
the middle of it, which are covered in a green slime.

This path leads off northwards from the main part of the swamp. 
The branches above are so close together that most light is blocked
out.  Rocks are still covered with green moss, along the the base of
the long since dead trees.  Frogs ribbit and even birds can be heard
high up in the trees.

there is some rustling behind the trees.

now.  Frogs, birds, insects, and more terrifying monsters.  The
muddy, marshy ground is hard to manuever through.

The dark path has finally turned off to the west.  It is difficult
to navigate through here because of the rocks and dead trees
everywhere.  Insects fly in over head, buzzing loudly and
investigating everything.  The very sound of the life in this room is
chilling.  Perhaps there are better places to be.

The beginning of a rotten, infested path~
This is the beginning of a rotten and infested path.  Everything
here has long been dead and happens to be crawling with insects and
other forms of life.  The trees are decomposing at a quick rate and
seem to be food to some insects.  The trees here loom just over head,
looking to snag the hats of travellers below.

Along the infested path~
This particular path is heavily infested with insects.  Many of
which have most likely never been seen before.  Some soar through the
air on large wings, others crawl about the ground searching for food.
They are everywhere here.  On the trees, on the rocks, and in the
mud.

An old, rotting path~
Everything on this path is old and rotting.  It seems as if it has
layed in the swamp for many, many years.  Stepping on any tree here
leads to the tree collapsing loudly into the swampy water. 
Everything here is drenched in water, which is probably why it is all
rotten and ready to fall to nothingness.

thick here, blocking most things of distance from view.  Move with
care.

The end of the muddy path~
Through the mist, it is clearly visible that the muddy path is
finally coming to an end.  Four or five large rocks stand at the end
of the "river" for travellers to leap and rest on.  As mossy as they
are, it looks very inviting.  The fog has lessened some here for a
change, but still remains generally thick and heavy.  Up ahead lies a
what seems to be a very wet pathway.

Further along a muddy path~
Nothing can really be said that is different about this muddy
pathway.  The branches still hang low, the fog lays very thick and
heavy, and the stepping rocks so to speak are becoming more and more
sparse.

Along a muddy path~
Further along this northwards bound path hasn't revealed much that
is different from the adjacent pathways.  The mud river still runs
through the middle of the path, navigatable by only the rocks.  The
fog here is also very, very dense, making the task of moving along
quite difficult.

A muddy path~
It appears the mud pit from the south is a continuing theme for
this path as well.  Like a dark brown, still river running down the
middle of the path, the muddy trail is rather difficult to navigate. 
Leaping from rock to rock can get very tiresome for some travellers,
especially with having to worry about low hanging branches.

Beside a pit of mud~
Laying exactly in the middle of the path is the largest pit of mud
in all of Thera perhaps.  The heat beneath it causes it to burp and
bubble profusely.  The area surrounding the mud pit consists mainly
of tall grass and rocks, both of which are overgrown with light green
moss.  The branches of the trees seem to hang normally for a change,
instead of looming just overhead.  This allows enough light to enter
the path so that travellers can make their way easily.  The fog is
here starting to get rather heavy and dense.

Heading towards a briar thicket~
Up ahead lies a gigantic briar bush.  It appears to be very old
and very dangerous.  The path that leads there is very old and
untravelled as well.  Most of the mossy rocks lay undisturbed, along
the the branches and their dead leaves.  The misty fog lays very low
to the ground here for some reason.  To the west, light just barely
shines in through the fallen trees.

A bend in the visible path~
The light from the swamp is almost faded now.  A bend is up ahead
in the pathway.  The grass remains moderately high and the rocks
become less and less as the ground becomes more and more muddy and
soft.  The branches now have forced past travellers to their knees. 
The fog is now quite thick again here.

A slightly visible path~
This path is still highly visible from the sunlight west of here. 
Weeds and grass stand tall here, almost to the waist of an average
sized human being.  Rocks are strewn here and there, covered with
yellow moss.  The branches are slowly staring to loom lower and lower
as the path moves along.

Before a thicket of sharp briar bushes~
To the south lies a giant bush of sharp briars. Peering closely, some
seem to have even reached a length of around 8 inches and could be potentially
lethal. Along the ground, it appears small creatures have burrow a small ditch
underneath the exterior of the bush to get inside. Why would they do that?

Within a thicket of briar bushes~
Crouching here would be the wisest idea.  Past travellers are
still caught up in these long, deadly thorns and briars.  There is an
eyeball here, piece of flesh there, and the occasional skeleton
caught within a patch of thorns.  Almost no light enters this bush,
making it all the more dangerous.  The ground here is rather shifty
and unstable.

A pit full of thorns~
Like most other travellers have found out, this is a death trap to
anyone.  It appears that the longest and hardest thorns and briars
have been cut from the bush and stuck into the ground, forming a
ground of razor sharp and piercing thorns.  Many, many skeletons lay
down here impaled upon the briars.  The odd thing is, all their
equipment, weapons, and armor have been stripped from their bodies
...

A vine entangled brush~
The vines have grown so thick here that it seems like the only
possible exit is back southwards.  Moss and ivy cover most of
everything within this brush.  The only light comes from the dimly
lit path to the south.  There is a strange scent of death here. 
Portions of the vines seem to have body parts hanging from them. 
Ears, scalps, and tongues seem to be the most common.  Dried blood
cakes the ground and the vines.  Rusted armor gleams out in the
darkness and then ...

Behind a bush~
Hacking through the vines to the south has proved to be
nothing more than a waste of time. This bush is very thick and
over-ridden with vines and weeds. Branches and broken leaves that cover
the ground make an terribly loud sound when being trampled upon. Tiny branches
seem to want to blind poor travellers who pass through here. Hurry and
push through!

A deadly quiet bush~
The previous bush leads travellers directly into yet another bush.
Crouched here listening, even the most brave travellers have been
scared by the almost unnatural silence.  Nothing can be heard, not
the trickle of water or the gentle buzzing of insects through the
air.  What makes things worse is that the bush itself is dead and
completely dry.

Within the silent swamp~
Surprisingly the swamp here is just as silent as the area
surrounding the bush before.  Nothing moves here.  It seems as if all
life has vacated this area, but for what reason?  Branches prod
downwards, mud clings and drags, and the moss here is even a dull,
dead grey color.

Somewhere on a hidden path~
The silent path has lead directly into this seemingly hidden
pathway through the backside of the swamp.  Shadows lie everywhere
within this path, hiding certain things and revealing others.  The
ground is actually rather dry here and the fog is nonexistant.  Rocks
and trees are the only thing hindering travellers through this path.

A turn through the bushes~
The bushes here are thin and easily manuevered.  To the west,
there seems to be a shadowed path, and to the north there seems to be
smoke rising very vaguely.  Moss covers the trees, giving off a
greenish tint to the area.

shadows still hide and reveal certain things about the path.  The
ground is still rather dry and unswamplike and the air doesn't smell
terribly moldy for a change.  The trees and branches provide most of
the shadows here, covering up the large rocks that lay everywhere.

The path has lead to another large bush.  It is particularly thick
and leafy, making it hard to manuever through.  Insects are
everywhere within the plant, however the light is not.  Struggling
through the thickness of the bush helps very little, until light to
the west is noticed.

A small thatched hut~
This hut is rather old and appears that it will fall apart at any
given moment.  Some strange magic holds this together.  Never could a
thin branch support a heavy log.  The room contains a table, a hole
in the wall serving as a window, something that resembles a
fireplace, and a chest.  The table itself is covered in numerous
different mushrooms and even dead frogs.  The fireplace itself burns
unnaturally off of nothing, and is heating a black kettle.  The chest
itself is very ancient.  Runes lie upon the exterior and seem to be
worn off.  Who could live in such a place?
