Before you stands a marvellous slender creature, slender and tall,
with the ears of an elf.  But as the figure steps out of the dark
shadows and steps into sunlight, you realize SHE is a drow.  Her face
is darkened, as if it had been burned.  Long hair flows behind her,
shining bright silver reflecting sunlight.  Two almond shaped eyes
glow green as jade, her elven heritage.  Her lips are pale and dry,
yet very charming...  Inviting.  She wears a brown leather tunic
recovered by a metallic breastplate with the emblem of her kingdom,
the owl, the animal that represents wisdom.  She wears her weapon
proudly, continiously placing her hand on her hilt, looking reassured
as she feels her blade still in place.  She wears on each wrist a
golden bracelet with various jewels.  Her legs are recovered by
leather pants, cleanly cut.

in the outlands are very happy with him, as his attire shows.

statue legend~
A Statue of the legendary uritel~
A statue of Doomsayer Uritel the Nefarious Cleric is here.
~
Standing about 6 paces tall, with shoulders slightly hunched,
Uritel surveys the area, his slitted amber eyes darting sporadically
about at the first sign of living things.  His skin is pitted and
tough, colored a mottled black as if caked onto his body by the
coal-smoke of many forges and firepits.  A much lighter olive green
pigment appears inside the pockets of his joints and up the curved
line behind his jawbone that - with his thick, rounded muscles -
gives him a disturbingly assembled look, almost as if he'd been sewn
together.  An unkempt mass of thick braids and greenish-black
dreadlocks falls about halfway down his back and is bound in various
places with round wooden beads.  Covering his face is a round wooden
ceremonial mask painted with various demonic symbols in red, a wide
contrast from the rich dark brown wood.  The mask disturbingly lacks
a hole for the nose or mouth, the only abrasions being two squared
horizontal slots for his eyes.  Also noticeable is that his left eye
is discolored in the pupil, shining a deep crimson instead of the
amber color of its iris.  The eye also leaves a trail of pinkish red
wisps of smoke as Uritel moves his head.  An aire of brutality
accompanies the Orc's savage appearance, but more unsettling is an
underlying aura that he is connected to some greater, unholy diety,
and is looking to serve him in any way possible.

~
Proudly standing before you is a young male Darnok. The musculature of this
man is very uncharacteristic of his race. Thick muscles ripple calmly under
his skin as he walks about the room. Shoulder-length jet black hair is neatly
kept hanging in a clasp. Piercing sky blue eyes peer outwards from their
sockets, taking in every little detail within the surroundings. For as much as
this Darnok looks to travel, his skin is very pale and unwrinkled.
Taking a closer look, the creature seems to be around 5'10" and looks to weigh
nearly 170 pounds. There is nothing particularly ugly upon his face aside from
the scar across his right cheek bone. He is large, looks to be highly skilled
and tremendously menacing and threatening.

letter resignation~
The letter is written in a bold and feminine Carolinian hand.

    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

A few years went by, and at the age of 17, Garon left the guild of magic, 
for he had now learned from them all and went in search of the befamed 
High Tower in the western parts of Thera to attain true power, true magic.
There, he was tested, a cruel test, The Test of the Hish Tower was not 
only of skills of magic, but of nature.  To see how dedicated the young
mage is, how far he was willing to go to obtain the true powers of the
magic.   Garon passed the test, if it may be said of that.  He defeated 
his opponents  and displayed excellent performance, but he was much
changed.  Throughout  his test, Garon had learned more about himself 
and magic.  He had learned that  his only lover, mate, content and life 
was the magic.  That he was willing  to sacrifice his life and the life of 
any for the sake of the Magic.  That he would break alliances, betray 
anyone for the love of Magic. For the sake of Magic.

A few years passed and Garon lived through such burdensome
circumstances.  He was always a loner, and spent most of his time
studying improving his wisdom and intelligence.  Then came the day
where the students were tested, in order to be admitted to higher
rank of sorcery.  Garon was nervous and had missed the half of the
night's sleep studying and memorizing the spells untill he could
repeat them even backwards.  The test was fairly simple, each
apprentice had to cast a minor spell successfully and Garon was one
of the three to have performed the spell correctly.  He was pleased
with himself, as he not only gained access to higher levels of magic,
but earned the admiration of his classmates.

Garon was the son of Ganon De-Esti and Moran Es-Mithan.  He was of
noble birth and was meant to be someone different.  At young age, the
giant learned to read, which very few of the giants ever learned in
their lifetime.  He was dedicated and ambitious in his study,
talented in the art of magic and when his skills were portraited
before his parents, he was sent to a guild of magic to learn the
mysterious ways of magic, which exceptional giants ever are
introduced to it.  He was pleased and was an attentive student always
eager to learn.  But his big size always made him the fool of the
class, always ridiculed and mocked off, always the one to bear the
names his classmates would attributed to him.  "The Bear" and "Tower
Man" were just a few of the least mean ones Garon would always then
seek solitute and cry to sleep, for being so different than the
others.  But never would he show that weakness infront of them.  He
would appear unhurt and careless to what they say.

{g============================================{x
 
A huge war broke out between all the nations of the
world.  Funokoshi chose to side with Torsanctus, which influenced
Waarlyn to be partial to them, until a deal was sealed with the Demon
Lord himself.  For a price, he was to assassinate any and all of
Torsanctus' enemies.  His job started with aid in pinning down the
Sage Paladar, and he even claimed the life of the Kii Master Hanzaki.
The kingdom of Lurai slowly fell apart with the assistance of
Funokoshi and Waarlyn in the war. For months the war kept raging onward.
Both sides claims the lives of their opponents. Finally, the Monks of Lurai
were driven into seclusion. The hordes of Torsanctus demons swept through
the land, claiming town after town in their name. Waarlyn, consumed by the
dark forces of UrremTier, grew into an entity that all of Thera came to fear.
the Witch-King of UrremTier terrorized the lands of Thera, always on
the prowl for wandering Lurai Monks. After a year or more of time had passed
the monks of Lurai made a reappearance to the lands of Thera. At this time,
the Witch-King was already making due progress with the newest General of
Torsanctus, known as Neil the Hell-Sprite. Together the swept up small bands
of monks, obliterating them. And so continues the legend of the Witch-King
of UrremTier.

{g============================================{x
 
Here, he chose to begin his new life.  He first met with
a giantess named Sakura, whom he adventured the unfamiliar lands
with.  As time passed, the darnok's skills in both battle and magic
grew to be very lethal.  He had many companions as he explored
throughout the realm of Thera.  Some of his most memorable ones were
Streggen, Zirius, Attalla, and even young Moritor.  In his younger
years, he began to make a living for himself by offering his services
as a bodyguard, head hunter, mercenary, and even an assassin.  His
first assignment was to assassinate Frisui of Torsanctus.  This trade
payed off quite well over the next few years and kept Waarlyn
well-fed and armored.  As he grew, he began to be admired by several
people throughout the realm.  Seeing this as an opportunity to pass
his knowledge onto others, he took on several apprentices.  They
included Grorg, an Orc of the same profession.  Zirius, a very strong
troll warrior and finally Attalla, a young orcan assassin.  They
absorbed his knowledge well, and followed him throughout the land. 
Their services were used by numerous people, and the Tower Guard
slowly began to rebuild itself.  While adventuring throughout the
realm, Waarlyn met and befriended a giant by the name of Funokoshi. 
These two quickly became best friends, despite their very obvious
differences.  That is how things happen sometimes, what else can be
said of that?

{g============================================{x
 
Born the son of Waarilien, son of Waarulhune in the Citadel of the
Darnok deep in the mountains of the North, Waarlyn first began taking
an interest in fighting and dark magic while observing his father,
the Captain of the Tower Guard.  Waarilien, and all his fathers
before him, had been the best and most proud of the Tower Guard in
their time.  As was tradition within the family, he took Waarlyn into
training with him at a very early age.  First came the weapons and
hand-to-hand combat skills, and when he had come to age, the dark
magics were studied.  The Tower Guards were renowed for their ability
to fight and for their ability to protect whoever they were assigned
to protect.  These Guards could be compared to the Praetorians of
Rome in both description and elite fighting tactics.  Upon reaching
the age of 16, Waarlyn was inducted into the ranks of the Tower
Guard.  He received an official duty among the men and proceeded to
carry it out.  As the year passed by, a war began to form between the
Darnok and the surrounding nations.  They were all in a state of
turmoil themselves and were desperately searching for food and water.
The Tower Guards were the first to see the thousands of savages
surrounding the Citadel.  For days and days, the hordes of savages
broke upon the walls like water on rock.  As was predicted, they
broke through the wall eventually.  All the citizens were slaughtered
that day.  Waarlyn, after swearing an oath to his dying father,
managed to flee through the sewerage tunnels deep below the surface
of the bloody streets.  Looking back from a distance, he saw his home
burning to the ground.  Anger swelled in his heart, and he swore to
uphold his ancestor's prestige for all time.  He made his way across
mountains, rivers, and forests on his way towards the prosperous city

As he left the syndicate, he encountered a mysterious man, the person
asked him to assassin an elf. Being a drow, Sesori happily accepted
the job. Because he gets to do something he enjoys while getting
paid at the same time. His target was an elf named Legolas. However, something
bizarre happened, when he was about to kill make his first attack
on Legolas, he felt a strong pulling force behind him and sucked him into
this warp hole. Coming out of the warp hole was a strange plane, a
place that does not exist on Thera. He is confused, and acted aggressively
against those who inhabits there... and even drew blood from a few of
them. In his surprise, the creatures of this plane seems to not care about
death or life as much as the mortals in Thera. As they showed no sad feelings
with each death of their fellows... Confused, he heard voices whispering 
saying how he is not ready yet. When he was about to ask "ready for what?" he
was once again pulled back into a warp hole, back to the same inn he was about
to assassinate Legolas, but Legolas is not there anymore, and the inn seemed to
have been forgotten in time. Since he came back from the warp hole. Sesori
has been hearing voices in his dreams, and was lead to a lake by the voice, at
which he met the speaker of the voice, a rogue diety by the name of Drenalus
who claimed himself to be the God of Magic and Nature. The rogue diety sent
Sesori onto a quest to find a tome, the Tome of Magic, he promised Sesori
that by obtaining the Tome he will also obtain great power. And with such,
Sesori started his quest to find the Tome of Magic.

The surface is just as Sesori as thought, the surface dwellers are
weak... and afraid of him because he is a drow. However, one thing
Sesori found perculiar is that he met with some other drows... who
are "kind" at heart, and wishes to help the others. That is an out-
rageous act, and it's something that Sesori cannot allow. Sesori brought
them to a place and asked for their explanation, they told lies, and 
Sesori saw right through it. Sesori, had enough of their non-sense, killed
them for Lloth on the spot. "Pshhhhh, drows wanting to share and help with
the surface dwellers..." just the thought of that made Sesori laugh.
Later on, Sesori found a group of people who called themselves the 
Syndicate. They offered great prizes for Sesori's help... though they call
themselves merchants, Sesori could tell they are a sly bunch at heart.
So Sesori decided to side with them and helped them as he saw fit. Yet,
Sesori found out they do not have the ambitions or evilness he desire,
so he soon left the Syndicate, and began his travel once more.

{B==================================================={x
 
 
None of the creatures who live on the surface know about
Sesori. Where he came from, who is he, or what is his 
bidding here on the surface. Others only assume that he is
from the Underdark (where the drows live), yet who he is 
and why he's up here on the surface rather than underground
always remained a mystery. In fact, Sesori was from the 2nd
house of the spiders. He was named Xazael when he stepped into
this world. However, due to the fact that he reminded many
of a once powerful Demon Sesori, The Keeper of Darkness of
Narssius, Sesori was named after him. For many of the priestess
believe Sesori is the reincarnation of the demon himself. 
Living in a society where the males receive no respects at all,
Sesori was not mistreated. In fact, Sesori received as much 
privelege as the females received. He is special, people can
feel it. One day Sesori saw Lloth in his dream. She told Sesori
that he is her Chosen One and that She is sending Sesori up to
the surface in order to teach the ignorant surface dwellers of
the right parth, the only path, Lloth's path. Sesori left Under-
dark the very next day.

And so, eventually the incompetance of Darkness as leader was realized. 
He had made an excellent leader when he was present, but his journey 
had taken him away.  Therefore, a new leader had to be found, and the 
decision was between Uritel, Mhyrtyn, and the dissolving of the 
kingdom.  Seeing the danger the Coven was in, Uritel adopted the 
attitude of a leader.  He made peace with the Order of Lurai, and began 
to orginize a seige to raise the morale of what few members were left.
 
Eventually, Darkness resigned, and Uritel became Demonic Lord in title 
what he had long been in act.  He was implanted with a demon spirit, 
and his left eye changed a bright crimson, the spirit's power radiating 
through his body.  Finally his dreams of power were being realized.
 
Since then he has been building the new Torsanctus from the ground up.  
Mhyrtyn seemed to have deserted the Coven, and so he recruited new 
members...Thalas, Frisui, Wistomaniac, and Kjell...to help him.  The 
rest is a future yet to be written.

{c=========================================={x
 
After struggling for some time to obtain power for himself, Uritel
saw potential in the Coven of Torsanctus.  They worshipped the dark
gods, and his divine was eagerly accepted by the leader of the Coven
as a valid being of worship.  Seeing the potential in the comradery
and resources that belonging to a Kingdom would bring, Uritel sought
this opportunity with haste, and joined the legion in hopes of
gaining power and influence in Thera with which to serve his creator.
 
Soon after joining, Darkness called upon Uritel to storm the Valley
of the Titans with a small seige-oriented unit from the ranks of
Torsanctus.  This was the first time the Orc had ever been seen
publicly without trying to make himself scarce.  Using his diety's
protection, he aided the seige by angering and leading away the
demons, guards, guildmasters, and, ultimitely, the royal family.
Seeing the contribution these cunning feats made to the war effort,
Darkness promoted him to the rank of Dark Acolyte upon the planting
of the demonic token.
 
Shortly after this invasion, the Demonic Lord began to journey to other 
lands, and showed his face to Thera less and less.  Slowly, the kingdom 
of Torsanctus began to die...until only Uritel and Mhyrtyn were left to 
carry the burden of the Demon.  The two went forward and attempted to 
conquer Gondor, but failed from lack of support.  Eventually even those 
brave two began to dwindle in morale, and it didn't help that Lurai was 
at war with the Coven...which was now made of only them.

However, if one was to ask him, Uritel would tell you that he was not
born, but created by the god Urrem'tier...or, as he refers to him, the
Unholy Divine.  He is his Disciple, and lives to carry out his will.
Long before he came to Thera, Urrem'tier made this creature of darkness
in a different plane, a barren world conquered by the divine years
before, covered in fire and ash, and full of only the most bizarre
living things.  Only a few days before his first appearance in New
Thalos, he was sent to Thera for the first time by Urrem'Tier's will.
He is the latest in a lengthly history of Disciples sent to Thera, 
one replacing each fallen Disciple upon his death.

Much of the town residence waries to speak of Uritel.  The recent
nature of his appearance aside, many commoners seem to have an
aversion for orcs in the first place, especially this particularly
savage-natured loner.  What information can be gathered is scarce. 
The method and origin of his coming is unclear, but since his arrival
rumours have been spread that the increasing number of disappearances
amongst the populus may have something to do with him, especially
after one such gossiper claimed to have seen him outside the city
walls performing some sort of exotic ritual to a dark god with the
corpse of a missing child.  Though these rumours themselves have no
real factual basis, trappers and rangers have seen Uritel hunting
what would normally be considered dangerous animals outside city
walls.  Also many of the townspeople assert accounts of him returning
from such trips with what appears to be traces of large quantities of
blood around his mouth, along with speckles of it from head to foot,
mace dripping with it, and gloves soaked.  Aside from these accounts,
though, no reliable information can be gathered.

Kjell was born in the deepest forests of Thera.  His parents were
weak, and had problems with living among the enviroments.  Creatures
lurked by their home all day, dangerous creatures.  Sometimes humans.
Wolves, boars, kangaroos, wizards, men, hunters, whiches...  One day,
when the mother of Kjell went out to gather firewood, a large man
came running towards her, angry!  She screamed, and daddy of Kjell
came to the rescue!  Kjell thought it was so boring without his
parents in his little crib, so he crawled out and out of the house,
when he saw his dead parents lieing on the ground, bleeding.  He saw
a large, angry man running from "the scene of the crime" and into the
forest.  Kjell fell to the ground shocked, and bursted into tears. 
He just lied there for several hours, crying, until it came 2 people
from the forest.  They walked toward him, the one whispered to the
other, "Lets take him with us home..."  .  They both smiled and
picked him up, and went on home.  Kjell was asleep most of the way to
the strangers home, so he didn't know the way there or how it looked
on the outside of the house.  Inside the house, they took him down
into a dark, cold basement and put him into a pit, covered in dirt
and bones.  In the pit there also was another Troll, a big rat, a
Felar creature, and a big bulley.  They all started to make fun of
him, because he was so small.  Everyday when it was feeding time, one
of the people that brought Kjell to their home, came down to the pit,
with 5 slices of meat.  The big bulley always took 2 slices so poor,
little Kjell wouldnt have anything to eat.  There was some piles of
hay in the pit that everyone slept on, but poor little Kjell had to
sleep on the concrete floor.  And sometimes at night, the bulley, the
rat and the Felar creature used to go over to Kjell and beat him up
so he would lie there all night, crying in agony.  The other Troll in
the pit didnt do much to Kjell, after some time, he used to stand up
for him, protecting him from the others.  So he also would be picked
on alot.  But one night they decided that this was enough!  So they
cooperated, getting themselves out of the pit.  In the basement,
there were many things, an old little sword and a mace was the only
weapons there.  So tehy took the weapons and went back into the pit,
and started to make mayhem!  Kjell pounded and crushed the big bulley
as much as he could because he hated him most of all!  The other
Troll was slightly stronget than Kjell so he sliced all the others
into pieces.  When they had settled down a bit and looked around,
there was nothing but blood and squashed flesh all around the pit. 
They both wanted more mayhem!  So they got out of the pit again, and
managed to sneak out of the house trough a basement window.

From there they decided to split and get on with their lives seperatly. 
So they went their ways into the deep forest.  Later on he found the
city of Sanaria, where he made many friends and liked to be.  After a
long time living there and walking around Thera doing things, he
spoke with Demonic Lord Uritel and decided to join Torsanctus.

droped the note and flew away.  He wondered what it could be...  He
opened the note and read it.  "Dear Hanzaki, Our friend Locke has
left us...  No one knows how it happened..  I was obligated to send
you this to inform you because you have the right to know...  So
there it is..  May the God be with him."  The note was note signed by
anyone..  But he guessed it was Legolas, Sad to hear the news ,
Hanzaki weapt for his friend Locke and prayed the Gods to lead him in
heaven.  After that Hanzaki decided to travel alone and to fullfill
his dreams alone as The Legendary Druid did.  They respected his
decision and left him.

He trained and trained harder and harder then
he ever did before.  He could even feel his skill improving...  Until
one day...  While he was sleeping,he had a deam...  A strange
dream...  A shining light approching him as he stared with eyes wide
open..  A old elf appeared , he knew it him...  Hanzaki The
Legendary Druid..  He flew by him and sat close to him. 
Pating his sholder,he said "Ahh...  Hanzaki" with a smile.  Mouth and
eyes wide open , a word couldn't come out from his mouth as he
started at him.  The legenday druid told him that he has surpassed
his knowlege and skills and told him not to precipitate thing s. 
Days later, Hanzaki met up with Legolas.  Legolas had a chat with him
about the his master that tought him some kind of forces called the
"Kii" and Hanzaki was interested and wanted to learn it also from
this master of his,but sadly he had passed away.  Hanzaki pated
Legolas on the shoulder and told him everything is gonna be alright ,
Legolas noded and said "i know,i am gonna fullfill what he asked me
to.  To make a kingdom, a kingdom by his name.  Lurai."  Hanzaki
smiled at him and told him he will stand by his side and help him out
with his kingdom.  Legolas agreed with his help but suggested before
making it,he would teach Hanzaki to the master the Kii first, and so
he did.  In only a few weeks, Hanzaki had mastered the Kii and later
on they both stared on building the kingdom.  When it was
built,Legolas was the Kii Master and Hanzaki became Luminaire,as in
second in command.  They had recruited several people in the kindom
such as Iraquia and Paladar,two great fighters and intelligent people
and many more.  After a few months, Legolas had a call from his folks
and has to leave to see his father that was sick and gave the
leadership of the kingdom to Hanzaki.  Hanzaki took good care of the
kingdom and became Kii Master for good.  They recruited more people
and tought them the force of the Kii.

Then a tragedy occured which greatly shocked and bashed Asuka's Kii 
abilities wildly, Raelothin was Killed in action by a mindless human 
thief roaming Sanaria.  Upon his death, Asuka was bewildered and exploded
with energy, her full potential was deployed by this emotional event.
Seeing her potential, ability and skill, the Order of Lurai made of
Rune Lady Asuka, Luminaire to fill up Raelothin's spot.  Greatly
griefed, she accepted the offer and decided to dedicate herself as
much as Raelothin had in the past and do an equal or superior outcome
of her work as Luminaire.  As time went by, Luminaire Asuka showed
much effectiveness and skill in the Order, she was both dedicated to
her work and encouraging to others.  As time went on and evil swarmed
the land, The General of the Lurai Armies, a troll named Trythog,
abandoned the kingdom.  The Kii, he had learned to harness and wield
he did in passion and desire for power, thus the Kii turned against
him and burned all life of him.  He became a demon and soon he began
massing an army, who he called Torsanctus, thus through Kii and
Lurai's teaching was born Demonic Lord Trythog.  A fine lesson I have
taught myself, Evil cannot be welcomed to Kii.  And so was waged the
first war of Thera's rebirth, the war between Good and Evil, the war
between Kii and Fire, the war between Order and Chaos, the war of
Lurai and Torsanctus.  For many months the forces of Lurai drew the
demonic armies into the shadows and liberated the lands which were
gouverened by the demons.  This done, along with Demonic Lord
Trythog's death to the Master of Kii Hanzaki, an anti-agression act
was agreed upon and the times of war ceased.  It was a bright

When she stepped into Sanaria she met with one of her childhood 
companions:Raelothin.  He talked to her of what he has been doing...  
He talked to her of Kii of the Elf Legolas and of the Order of Lurai.  
Asuka was quite astonished to hear her elf-dispising friend speak so 
nicely of elves but she trusted his jugement.  He offered her to join 
him and he would teach her Kii and what he has learned from the elves. 
She accepted and Asuka was now a student in the Order of Lurai under
the supervision and tutoring of Luminaire Raelothin of the Order of
Lurai.  Asuka leaned the mysterious force known as Kii and learned to
wield it herself.  She was rather skilled at the art and within
practice became Rune Lady Asuka.  Such rank was an honor for her but
she had still much to learn and much more to learn from those elves
which she held a such horrible vision of.  They were after all not so
bad once you learn to live with them; they are quite bearable. 
Asuka's training proceeded and she grew strong and more
adept,familiar and skilled with Kii.  Her Kii abilities were beyond
their borders and her potential seemed infinite.

Asuka was born in Drow city in a poor numerous family of many
children.  She was the third and youngest girl of the family.  At the
age of 14 her sister Asuki,who was a year older than her, and herself
had to leave and work in a local bar in order to bring back home some
gold to supply the family with the least of food.  As the days went
on, Asuka got more and more skilled in the art of singing, it was
what she did at the inn.  She sang as her sister Asuki danced.  Soon
she learned that her songs had a certain power...  A mysterious
power...  Each song had its unique art and blessings...  Some could
even cure the wounded and strenghten one and raise their morals. 
Such was her gift...  Her powers...  Her curse...  Within a few weeks
she left the local inn and search of something that will bring her
peace happiness and more wealth then what she was earning...  Her
first destination was Sanaria, more specificly she wanted to sing for
Bradley's Inn, the largest and most crouded inn of Thera.

In remembrance of the setting sun
Upon waves of deepest blue,
I watch the dancing colors
Within the eyes of you.
 
Cascading silver embrace your face
Like moonrays through night descend,
A temptress smile, promises unspoken
The Divine surge of love forcing me to repent.
 
The Embodiment of love, an effigy of beauty
Silvara The Goddess of love
The celestial mistress of My heart and dreams
Ruling from heavens above.{X

A once great and noble friend, who i miss so dearly
Slipped away one night, never to be seen by anyone again.
O how I wish I could once more see her delicate features,
Accented so deeply in the crystal twilight, making me
     Long for one last wish, a wish pure of heart, of love.
A wish, for if I lose, choose to take my life from the
     World I have come to know, to respect, and to fear.
     The Heaven I have come to rejoice and eternally live in
     The Hell I will be forced to burn and decay within.
For this is my last, true wish.{X

Oh Silvara how ugly you are!
I see you upclose but I wish it was by far.
When I look at you it makes me gag
Like something out of a cheap porno mag.
Although you are powerful and have your holylight lit,
I think you are gay and a little dimwit.
But do you care what I will say, 
You always slay me day after day.
You always are angered and full of strife!
I see your name on the wholist and wonder,
"Does this girl have a life?"
But when I'm in need you always come through.
It is your job even though you suck at it too.
You smell like dead roses and rotting potpies,
When people walk by they wish they had died.
Silvara I hope I will slay you one day,
But now it is time for me to go away.{X

top of a stone gracefully shaped in a stairlike manner.  Four torches
take place in each corner of this room, giving lots of light so you
can see what you wish of pictures and other details.  In front of the
statue is a stone block, and ontop of the block is a book containing
the life story of Asuka.

Melancholy's Maps~
As you walk in, a sudden gust of wind enters the shop and sends several
scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred 
up stings your eyes, and take a look around the shop.  This shop is cluttered 
with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with 
slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll 
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you, 
and to the left is a window overlooking the Common Square.  A small door, 
half hidden by a stack of books, leads to a room in the back of the shop.

full of Melancholy's trappings from her adventuring days.  On a small table
under a window to the east is a vase with a single white rose.  Other than

Intersection of Western Wall Road and Grace Street~
You are standing at the intersection of Grace Street and Western
Wall Road.  Grace street continues to the east and Western Wall Road
follows the wall around the city to the north and south.  The road
leading east is well traveled and appears busy.  You see many people
traveling this way.  The road that follows the wall is clean, and
provides an easy rout around the city without getting caught in a
crowd.

Soma's House~
As you enter Soma's house you smell first of all {RB{rl{Ro{ro{Rd{x
and sweat.  The smell in this house is covered up by burning
inscence, which doesn't help all that much.  The floors in this room
is wooden, for look and cleaning reasons.  The house is very large,
this troll either has a rich grandparent or he is a very wealthy
traveler.  In the center of this room is a fine fine oak table, very
well finished and seems to be top of the line.  Around this 10 foot
table is chairs, very fine oaken chair.  The room is surrounded by
windows and has freshly cut roses on the table.  To the south is Wood
Crest drive, and to the north is Soma's bedroom.

Soma's Bedroom~
As you step into Soma's master bedroom you first notice a very
large bed is placed in the center of this room.  The bed has four
posts coming up made of fine oak and pine.  The bed has a plain wool
blanket on it that is neatly layed on top of the bed.  The bed has 2
pillows, the finest duck fur in the land has gone into those.  The
floor is made up of wood, with a very crude finish, or maybe its just
the constant clawing from Soma's giant claws.  There is numerous deep
scatches in the walls, signs of stress and normal day life as Soma. 
In the corner of the room is a large steel weapons rack, with Soma's
finest blades leaning agaist it.  To the south is back into Soma's
main living room.

are blueprints of several types of boats, mostly just kayaks, canoes
and rafts though.  In the large pool you can see 2 kayaks and a canoe
floating, they are most likely being tested for being waterproof.  To

fancy.  A small stone column stands in the middle of the room, and on
top of it is a fancy black book lying open showing what direction you
have to go to see which rooms of the museum.  There are hallways
south west and east of here.  To your north is the museum entrance.

But the walls here are made of some fine wood, and covering these
walls are different portraits of Sesori, and lists over people and
powerful creatures that he has killed.  The statue of him stands on
top of a stone gracefully shaped in a stairlike manner.  Four torches
take place in each corner of this room, giving lots of light so you
can see what you wish of pictures and other details.  In front of the
statue is a stone block, and ontop of the block is a book containing
the life story of Sesori.

arial~
You open a book titled 'The wonderful world of Arials, Felars, and Merma'
 
 
The great Elven Sage Selowyn has told those who inquire, that these feral
races were conjured up by a hopeful Druid. In a vain and unnatural attempt
to link the sane with the savage, this lost yet powerful Druid called up
three animals representative of the natural world. The result was more or
less three creatures, well-nigh their natural counterparts. Losing most
of their instincts, and natural innate abilities, these creatures were
considered nothing more than mutant humans. Yet the forlorn Druid was not
going to give up, he had lost his true love tragically already, he was not
about to lose this. He named his creations...Aria, Fela and Merma.
Selowyn has said that the Druid was earnest is his striving to bring
something good to the land, but he says that the Druid was more concerned
with finding out if he could, rather than deciding if he should. The Druid
is said to have been found months mangled beyond nearly all recognition.
Arial, Felar and Merma were gone, only to be found years later living in
small packs throughout Thera. What was left behind however, was a less
than complete doctrine titled "fauna faux pas". Selowyn is said to have
destroyed this book, but many think his undying expedition for knowledge
has kept him from doing so. It is also rumored that whatever killed the
Druid was not of this natural world and that the Druid had been working on
much more advanced 'creations'. Many simply believe that the straying
Druid dabbled in divine magics and suffered the consequences as such. 
 
Anyway, three races now exist in Thera because of all of this.
Arial, Felar and Merma. They have few of their natural abilities,
but still have their instincts to some degree. They are all intelligent,
as was misled Druid of their origins. They speak enough to be understood
are look much like the animals they were created from in every way
except that they take humanoid form, walking on two legs and using
two arms. All of them still possess keen animal eyesight and can see
clearly without light. Also, the three races get along with each other
very well and consider one another related, despite the differences
shown by their natural counterparts. However of them share the beauty
of their natural counterparts, despite their counterfeit origin.
Arial are roughly the same height as the average human, but of a much
slighter build. Brought into being with the outline of a bird of prey,
they make agile fighters. They have feathers of all colors, as well as
small claws and varied beaks. 
Felar are a cat like creation formed with the great cats in mind. They
are well suited for the fighting classes and have retained more of their
survival instincts than the other feral races. The Felar culture is one of
extreme honor and hierarchy. Each member knows and honors their position.
 
Merma are a race designed after a myriad of the seas fish. Of all the
Feral races, they are perhaps the ones most suited to magic, especially
clerical magic. They are usually fairly good natured and more serene
than Felar. They speak with a bit of a gurgle or bubbling and love to
spend time in the water, even though they can not breathe it. Merma are
covered with glinting scales that can vary from blue to green, white to
yellows, and even and some of red or pink hues.

griffin~
You open a large book, the cover illustrates a griffin in flight.
 
The Griffin, Gargoyle, and Draconian races are said to have migrated to the
Theran midlands during a dark epoch of confusion and severance a few thousand
years ago. Coming from the drab outer stretches beyond Thera, these races had
a difficult time adjusting when Thera brought itself from that dismal age.
Not having found their niche, these races still act as they did in their
ancient homeland.
 
Griffin are virtuous beast with a lion's body, an eagle's head, and wings.
These commingled creatures pursued the Draconians when they left their land
to prey on the innocent of Thera's midland. Before their dispersion to Thera,
Griffen were but a myth, as were their Draconian and Gargoyle counterparts.
However, Griffin are presently famed for their interminable fight against
evil, especially their enemies of yore, the Draconians. Griffen can detect
all that are evil without effort and have full use of their efficient wings.

ethereal~
You open a large book titled 'The secret lives of ethereals'
 
Ethereals origins and species progression is unknown. They do come from
another plane, possibly a wizard summoned them and lost control and they
started to reporduce on this plane. They have no discernable body or
mass, simply a floating mist which makes them highly resistant to weapons
but electricity and fire are tremendous weaknesses of theirs due to the
water particles present in their form. They can fly and are some of the
best minds in Thera. They are more akin to mage professions than fighting
and are good natured only. Some xenophobic types are very skeptical of
Ethereals and their constant reference to 'solids', while other more
intellectual types are intrigued and learn from them. Needless to say,
Ethereals are a wonderful race and only hope to do wonderful things
in this new home of theirs. Ethereals are also reknowned for their
somewhat unique ability to fight Wraiths. Most other races find this
to be somewhat difficult, being that they are so different.

pixie~
You open a small book titled 'You mysterious world of pixies'
 
Pixies, those tiny magical creatures, are said to have been created by
a goddess for her amusement. They are, by their very existence, magical.
They are often invisible and like to keep secrets. Pixies are quick,
inquisitive, and generally have a playful nature. They are physically
fragile and not very stong, though they make up for it with their
remarkable agility. Pixies all fly, and have cute little iridescent wings.
They range from 1 to 4 fingers in height, 5 coins to 2 stones in weight,
and live for an average of 120 years. Pixies are able to see many things
other creatures can not. They see all that is magical, including those
things or beings invisible. They can also see those that try to hide
themselves in the woods and can sense any evil.
~
E
elf~
You open a leather bound book titled 'The Elves of Thera'
 
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build. They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind. The average elf is approximately 6 1/2 spans tall
and 70 to 180 stones in weight. Elves are very long lived and their thousand
year lives give them much to think about. Some even think themselves immortal
in their racewide vanity. Elves always appear young to some degree and have
a fair complexion throughout their years. Elves also happen to be the first
sentient creatures to be created and live in the realm. And, for those early
years, they were only good, singing praises to nature and dancing and playing.
However, since the time when all fey were pure and one, they have split.
Eons ago, for unremembered reason, the Elves split and the Drow emerged.
Since then the Drow have always fought with their ancient cousins. As well
as causing some Elves to turn evil, there were also those Elves who set
themself apart entirely in their neutrality. Most pure Elves today are
of good alignment, but there are still those few frowned upon neutrals.
Thought to be only half-fey, the Drow treat these neutral elves as they
would any other elf.
~
E
dwarf~
You open a book title 'A guide to Dwarven Culture and Custums'
 
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina. These two things make them every barkeepers nightmare, enhanced
by the fact that they are without question the best drinkers in Thera.
Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim,
and so are very vulnerable to drowning. Dwarves are also extremely
fond of precious stones and metals. The Dwarves that have given up their
traditions tell stories of many of their kin who spend their entire
lives in their own mines far up in the mountains away from civilization,
muttering incessantly in hopes of striking it rich. Most other Dwarves
simply mine for various raw ores that they sell for meager profits.
Some Dwarves have found their metal working skills to be very valuable
in the midlands, other Dwarves make a living as fighters, and some even
as Clerics. Although magic is not thought of highly in Dwarven culture,
Clerics are more or less embraced for their divinity. Dwarves can see
very well in the dark, and average 4 paces in height. They are extremely
stocky and proud of their beards, no matter their sex. Other races have
a hard time telling the difference between a male and a female Dwarf,
but this does not seem to bother them, perhaps the eventual loss of
hair on their head accounts for this groping pride of their beards.

E
cyclops~
You open a book titled 'Cyclops of the Oss Remnants'.
Cyclops are giant types with one large eye in the center of their
forehead. Usually light skinned, they are sometimes seen in light
blues and aqua green colorations. Some of them have hair, and even
ponytails, but most are bald, with wrinkled brows. Often seen with
thick gold and silver hoops pierced through their ears, nose, and
even eyebrows, these huge beast usually cause quiet a fearful stir.
However, most Cyclops are very good-natured and fight against evil.
Smarter and wiser than the giants of past, these lumbering oafs
fled Thera long ago, when their noble kingdom was destroyed by an
evil coalition of giants and trolls. Cyclops now live in caves,
usually alone on their own small island. Most of them live in close
proximity to one another on a chain of islands known as the Oss
Remnants. Cyclops have the ability to detect that which is evil and
range from 2 1/3 to 3 1/2 spans tall, and up to 3 blocks in weight.
No one knows for certain how long they live, because they do not
keep track themselves. It is conjectured they live hundreds of years.
~
E
troll~
You open a smelly book titled 'Bed Time Stories to scare your Youngsters'
 
Used in stories to frighten children, in war stories to impress bar lasses
and as sources of humor in puppet shows, the troll is always a villain for
the "civilized" world.  Standing well over the tallest human, their
monstrous looks and unclean smell have earned them this image.
Living in low and dark swamplands, the troll have grown used to the dark
acrid air and can see very well without light. Being some of the most hearty
of many of the races, few wounds ever are deep enough to cause long term
damage to a troll. Though the fact brings much fear into human infantry,
it is now well known that fire and acid cause great damage to these brutes.
Due to their nature, all trolls are evil.  And because of their lack of
proper learning, they are often to dull to become learned in the ways of
magely sorcery.  They are among the strongest of all the races and are not
thought to live exceedingly long lives, perhaps even less than a humans.
Swamp trolls also have the instinctive ability to detect all that is "good".

duergar~
You look over a large tome intitled 'Duergar: Fiction or Fact?'
 
Duergar are the dark dwarves, who have long turned away from the good
and fair lives of their ancestors.  Duergar are a little smarter than
the dwarves, but a little weaker, since they gave up the hard job of
working stone from the bosom of the land.  Duergar mainly choose to live
underground, probably because they still feel a kinship in their blood
with the stone, though they can live anywhere.  They range from 3 1/2 to
4 paces in height, 95 to 155 stones in weight, and live for an average
of 400 years like their Mountain dwelling kin. Duergar have much the
same manners as dwarves, except they are simply evil as far as morals go.
Although Duergar still have an unexplainable desire for gold and the like,
they would rather steal it, instead of gruelling through manual labor.
Duergar hate elves as their cousins used to, and have recently allied
warily with the Drow to destroy the thin blooded fey. The alliance is not
a very strong one, it may or may not last. Duergar can also see in the
dark like their cousins.

drow~
You open a small book with a picture of a deadly spider on the cover.
 
The Drow have the distinction of belonging to the first sentient race to
live on Thera. They share this will all Elves, though some Elves fail to
acknowledge their relation to the Drow.  The Drow turned their backs to
the light to embrace evil, thus becoming the second sentient race in Thera
They no longer feel comfortable in natural settings, surrounded by growing
things. They have gave that life up long ago and have since found their
home in the underworld with other evil races. Now, if they sing, they sing
into the darkness, they sing to the night. The drow are adept at controlling
the web of life, shaping it to their whim. They are slightly more intelligent
and slightly less robust than the high Elves, their ancient foes. Drow range
from 5 1/2 to 6 paces in height, 85 to 140 stones in weight, and live for an
average of 1200 years just as their Elven cousins. Drow can also see very
well in the dark.
~
E
vexie~
You open a small book entitled 'Vexies: The distant cousins of pixies.'
 
Not so long ago, a few criminal Pixie were banished from their for having
committed crimes against the Pixie kingdom. The fate of these pixies was
to have their wings removed, along with part of their magic. The Vexies,
as the other races now call them, are all evil, and earthbound, until very
recently. A dark god, finding himself very fond of these nasty creatures,
branded them as his own. Giving them replacement wings like those of a
wyvern, the vexies were able to fly once again. This sinister god also
granted them back the use of their Pixie detection abilities. Most Vexies
choose to live in caves and have been known to make entire colonies of bats
disappear. They are a bit less agile than Pixies, but more intelligent and
stronger than them.  They range from 1 to 4 fingers in height, 5 coins to
2 stones in weight, and live for an average of 120 years. Along with the
new wings came dark scales and viscious fangs. Along with their wicked
black hair and painted faces, Vexies have the most vile and unique look
of all Thera's creatures.
~
E
wraith~
You open a book titled 'All you wanted to know about wraiths, and more'
 
Wraiths are odd translucent beings. They are not thought to be related to
Ethereals, but they are definitely similar. Wraiths have been in Thera as
long as can be remembered. It is thought they are the lost spirits of those
that died horribly violent deaths. Unable to find a final resting place,
they can do nothing but wander the land. Wraiths are not necessarily evil
by nature, but they are driven insane by their form and predicament. So
it is that all Wraiths seek revenge on the violent world that caused them.
Wraiths are resistant to weapons to a high degree, yet fire and electricity
are particularly effective in disturbing their amorphous state.
~
E
gargoyle~
You open a large dark book with a picture of a statue on the cover.
 
The Gargoyle, Griffin, and Draconian races are said to have migrated to the
Theran midlands during a dark epoch of confusion and severance a few thousand
years ago. Coming from the drab outer stretches beyond Thera, these races had
a difficult time adjusting when Thera brought itself from that dismal age.
Not having found their niche, these races still act as they did in their
ancient homeland.
In the dark outer lands, the Gargoyle are the protectors. The struggle between
the Draconian and Griffin adversaries caused much human bloodshed and the Human
population out there was near gone before these races migrated. The Gargoyle
were the saviors of Humans in that dark epoch of time. They have continued as
guardians in the present with the continued fight of Griffin against Draconian
in their relatively new home in the midlands of Thera. Remaining neutral to
the clash between their counterparts, the Gargoyle are covert in their deeds
and prefer to act at night when they are strongest. Gargoyle can detect magic
and see in the dark without a problem.
~
E
human~
~
E
human~
You open a plain book, the cover is devided into four different sections.
 
Humans are a relatively new race to the land of Thera, but by no means
inferior. Their versatility have allowed them to thrive in the short time
they have walked the land. Now, they are the most widespread race in Thera.
Due to their adaptability, Humans can take up and succeed in nearly any
profession. They range from 5 to 6 1/2 paces in height, 100 to 240 stones
in weight, and live for an average of 80 years.  Humans have the most
variety of any of Thera's races in size, shape, and color among its members,
even albinos are not uncommon. Humans diversity extends also to their range
of alignments as they can be any.
 
Most of the Humans in Thera, come from one of four backgrounds. From their
respective backgrounds, Humans can still end up in any profession. The
four categories only refer to the characters' upbringing and adventurers can
do little to find out what category a human is from. Of course, the characters
own public background and actions may reveal his or her upbringing. With these
categories come not only differences in character but also differences in how
one might be treated...prejudice, patronidge, and fear are but a few examples.
Again, these represent only your characters childhood. It can be thought of
as what your parents were, or what you were meant to be. It does not by  any
means have to be what your character is now that his or her adolescence has
ended. For example, a Human-Parson may have always thought his parents were
wrong in their religion, so he becomes a Defiler, or even a Maligner. On the
other hand, a character dubbed as a Human-Parson may have studied religion
and worked with the church much in his youth so as to become a grand
cleric.
In general the 4 categories are very similar, with small changes as due to
their upbringing.
The Parson is one whose background may have included working
with the church or living with those who were very religious.
These types are able to recognize magic when they see it.
The Aristocrat is one whose background may have involved any
participation in the government or perhaps being born as a noble
or child of a senator. They are usually keen to sly diplomatic ways.
 
The Militant is one who may have been the child of a cityguard,
or just one who studied much of the arts of combat with a mentor.
They pick up weapons and know how to use most of them with skill.
The Vagrant includes any who are farmers, peasants, nomads,
drifters, circus performers, slaves. Poor shopkeepers and traders
or merchants would also be considered vagrants if they were too
poor to be classed as Aristocrats by involvement. Most of them
are able to see much more clearly in the dark than any of the
other more pampered human divisions.

Hanzaki~
You have entered the room dedicated to the legendary Hanzaki.  An
identical statue of him stands here, but something tells you that
just because it is a statue, it wouldn't be wise to attack it.  The
floor here is the same as everywhere in this museum, black marble. 
But the walls here are made of some fine wood, and covering these
walls are different portraits of Hanzaki, and lists over people and
powerful creatures that he has killed.  The statue of him stands on
top of a stone gracefully shaped in a stairlike manner.  Four torches
take place in each corner of this room, giving lots of light so you
can see what you wish of pictures and other details.  In front of the
statue is a stone block, and ontop of the block is a book containing
the life story of Hanzaki.

Sanaria.  The road is well maintained and there are various houses
here.  The yards of these houses have been kept well.  The shrubs are
trimed and there are trees growing here, where throughout the city
you have seen few other types of vegetation.  You can go east from
here along Woodcrest drive or east to Council Crest drive.

Andy's Pub~
The busy pub is filled with patrons.  People are laughing and singing.
A minstrel plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people
are even dancing.  Andy, the pubs owner, wanders around and checks to see
that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your south.  East
of you is another section of the pub.  You know that there are rooms to
be had somewhere around here...

men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this

He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is

Although the floor is dominated by a large table, the most stiking feature 
may be the explosion of plants throughout the room. It is almost as though 
the table sits in a forest clearing. A bust on the west wall presents the 
image of a kindly gargoyle smiling despite the long scar running from his 
temple to his cheek. It is inscribed in a flowing script, "Be at Peace in 
this place."  In the north-east corner, there appears to be a staicase

An Entrance Room~
As you enter this room, the first thing you notice is the strong
and foul odor.  It smells like old blood and something else you cant
quite identify.  The room looks somewhat old, the windows facing the
street is brown and barely transparent.  There is a burned out torch
on the wall, and some dead flower pots in the corner of the room. 
The walls are a little dirty with a dark wooden color to them, the
floorboards squeak some as you step on them.  The door to the west of
you leads to the street outside, the door's hinges are somewhat rusty
and the door sways open and shut from the wind.  There is a room to
your east where the horrid stench seem to come from.

A Bloody Room~
Eww!!  The stench in this room is so bad that you gag just by
breathing here.  There is very little light in this room, only some
light from the room west of you shine into this room, but there is
not much pleasant to see here.  The room has bloodstains everywhere
in it.  The walls are soaked in blood, the wooden boards looks like
they have been painted dark red from all the dried up blood.  The
floor isnt any nicer either.  This might have been used as a living
room before, there are a couple chairs here and a small table.  There
also is a fireplace in the corner but it doesnt look like it has been
used for a long time.  You start to wonder what the heck happened
here..  You notice a hatch below your feet.

A Dark Cellar~
You almost trip on the squeaky half-rotten ladder that leads down
here.  This room doesnt smell as awful as the room above you but its
not exactly pleasant either.  Strangely enough, there is a lit torch
on the wall here, and it shows that this room is a storage room and a
wine cellar.  There are crates and boxes on top of eachother around
the room.  You can see from the hatch above you that some blood has
run down the cracks around it and run down the walls here and made
some ugly marks.  A large wine rack is on the all south of you, many
fine brands, many others.  You can only go up again from here.

guard stands on either side of the gate, arms folded, with a cold
look that lacks any compassion.  Strictly business for these guys. 
The road here is made of a reddish clay packed by ages of travel.  To

Travel is quick and easy along this lonely and desolate street. 
The only people that usually travel this road is an occasional guard
strolling to their post.  The ground here is made of a hardened red
clay.  It is easy to tell that this street has been used by the
guards for many years because of the deep trenches worn here by the
guards on their daily route to work.  An enormous wall of stone runs
the length of the outer edge of the city along this road.
