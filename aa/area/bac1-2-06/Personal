Yesterday, the powerbox of my computer (the stupid little)

Anyway, to fix this, I will have to format my harddrive to

week to fix up the computer after that but it will be done

Subject Proposed battle strategy~
Text
Mordukhan has a major problem with facing authority.  They
will take over any area we take unless we set up some guards.
 
Also, this war will be costly so I propose that we take a no
holds barred attack strategium against the scum.  We should
full loot every Mordukhan who is killed and then sell off the
stuff for major money (but keep what you will use).  If you
can't use or sell it, then sacrifice it.
 
Secondly, they will start to whine like little babies once
we start kicking in thier anus's so I propose that we make them
pay us monitarily like they had done to Argus earlier.  Then
we keep crushing them.
 
 
Aldon, I hope you will join our alliance.  Mordukhan attacked
Argus, a kingdom designed to help other kingdoms in times of
strife because they thought that they were becoming too powerful.
 
You must stand up now and stop them because if Mordukhan wins
you can be sure that you will be next.

need 100 vnums set aside, with me as the builder, so I
can transfer to there the valley leading to the castle
and so that i can build the town there.  Here are the
different things that i need prices on:
 
- Hp/Mana regen rate upgrades for the healer
-Reduced prices at the healer
-Standard roads (like for streets)
-Corridors in the castle
-Private rooms in the castle
-Guard mobs, preferably tougher than the garisson mobs,
 but not quite what Mord's was
-A bouncer with a mprog that will keep nonmembers out
 of the healer and the donation room
-The cost of a shop
-A house in the city
-A fountain
-Shopkeepers with goods to sell (bread, fruit, drinks, etc)
-Citizens to roam the streets
-A park
-benches in the park
 
That's all for now.  If I think of anything else i'll
note it.

=======================================================
If you are the kingdom admin and aren't happy with my
pricing then maybe you should have said something when
Sarlos complained. I didn't hear one word from you about
kingdoms and stuff, so I was only able to assume that
it was my responsibility.
Towns cost money to build, they aren't free you know.
And they most definately won't be cheap.
As for the 1k+ per rank, perhaps I should have been a
bit more clear. The 1k includes any extra stuff that
the specific rank may want or have added to his room.
Sort of like the more powerful someone is, the better
living conditions they have.
And the kingdom mprog IS implemented yes, but the mprog
code itself is so bugged up it isn't working properly.
Me and Kazmir spent hours toying with it, trying to get
it working but to no avail.
How the Mordukhan guardian works is that it allows any-
body evil to enter, which I think works better in a
Roleplay aspect since the kingdom itself is evil and
would only reconize those also evil as being safe.
And as for saving stuff in containers, why not just set
up donation pits inside Gondor Castle? I kinda like the
idea of having kingdoms donations go to their own area.
Anyways, I think this is enough rambling for me. If it
is possible perhaps we can get together sometime and 
discuss this in detail, I really don't like note relay
all that much.

Eron nochanned a guy without using judgement or thought just
because the guy sweared once.  It may seem hypocritical for me
to complain and remove the nochan but I have seriously changed
my ways (you can see a major difference in the laxed attitude)
 
I removed the nochan because it was based for an imm and it
may have become one of the 40-50 min nochans
 
 
I sincerly wonder why you give newbie imms commands such as

Subject I told ya so~
Text
As you guys may or may not remember when you set up the immortal
council at the end of FoK2, I told you that it would one day
come back and bite you guys in the ass.
 
I was right.
 
 
I applaud Mcdain's sudden growth of a backbone on the issue of
cussing on public channels but I still think a lot more could be
done.
 
1.) Make all immortals accountable ONLY to Takeda, Explorer and Derkec
    - I know I don't do much because if I screw up I hear it from
     8 different sources in the future.
 
2.) Let's take back the friggin mud!
    - Once again I thank Mcdain for finally getting tough.
      but alot more can and must be done to keep the mortals in
      line.  And don't feed me that crap about losing the friggin
      player base!  We've lost majority of our good players because
      of all those asshole players who keep complaining and whining!
 
3.) Eliminate the council!
    - Make all immortals responsible for thier jobs and not the
     jobs dumped on us by the lazy immortals.  (I'm looking at you
      Kazmir)
 
4.) Let's make this a fun place to be!
    - Have spontaneous and silly quests again
    - Make fun of the morts and let them make fun of you
    - Don't take everything personally
    - Use the title skill more often
 
You may think I'm outta line on this but I hate watching this
mud that I've helped alot fall to dust because nobody can do anything
without the council's permission, leaving every immortal with
thier thumbs up thier asses.

I am quite aware of all the work Kazmir does for the mud but
he is taking far too much work for himself that he can handle.
 
He should leave the eq fixes and kingdom areas to the builders
The rule-breaking and pk notes to the justices
 
Basically, I'm saying that everybody should do thier own
job and not bother doing the jobs of the other immortals.
 
I didn't mean to finger out Kazmir but he does take an extraordinary
ammount of work that is not humanly possible to finish
 
 
I could say for instance:
 
Porthios, should stick to building and leave pk notes to the
justices.  (Not meaning to point you out either)

I almost forgot.  I cannot do anything more than tell the immortal
staff what PK notes are bad, fix bad names and stop cussing on
the public channels because the immortal council has to okay every
thing I do on this mud that relates to the players.
 
 
That means if somebody cheats, I have to report it, wait for the
vote, then get Mcdain to do it because I haven't been given any
of the commands needed for doing my job.

Akuji will like slayed to have Aegrath for multikilling
 
Help pk rule 4
4 ) The repeated killing of one character over a short amount of time
    will not be tolerated.
 
Sun Sep  3 19:31:25 2000 :: Akuji killed by Aegrath at 3009
Sat Sep  2 23:49:34 2000 :: Akuji killed by Aegrath at 25200
 
I less then 24 houres but it not a short time so i see
no bracking of that rule at all, multikilling as i see it
is more then one time the 1 to 4 houres
 
when it more then 10 houres later it not multikilling just war
 
If you don't think i am right here note me back
Then i think he have to write donw what ppl think is a short time

Looks legit to me.  The rule is meant to be interpreted and I
don't think there was anything malicious about it.  Twice in a day
is usually alright with me, especially in war situations.  When an
experianced player is beating on a newbie or people are killed
twice in an hour, then we have a responsibility to step in.

alright, i dont know the time he did it, but it was earlier today...
about 1 or 2 est.
 
help pk, rule 4.
it states that killing someone multiple times within a short period
of time will not be tolerated.
 
last i heard (which wasnt very long ago) was that period of time was
24 hours. I heard this from when i used sithas to help a friend go
after imrahil. Aegrath broke this rule by killing me twice within
24 hours, once last night and once earlier today.
 
Punishment in my opinion should be slay and either i get his eq or
it is eaten. In the imrahil case he got to take whatever he wanted
of my friends and i had to give all imrahil's eq back.

Good job on stopping the war with Mordukhan.
 
I have been informed that because you started it, you pretty
much screwed up your RP.  Please refer to the ARGUS_RP helpfile
for more information on it.
 
You may be angry at Mordukhan now but because of your RP, you
will eventually need to help them when they are the weakest
kingdom.
 
 
To pick up bonus RP points (skills and stuff) all you need to
do is help out the weakest kingdom, which I believe is Narcissus.

A few options.
 
1: We should be able to see kingdom rank on 'who.'
2: We should be able to hear talk on kingdom channels

A thought.
 
We should consider the concept of having kingdoms with
multiple leaders.  Currently, a kingdom with several 
people in rank 1 would have a significant advantage oer
over* a kingdom with one leader, because they would have
more people who have access to several kingdom skills.
Should this be legal? Or what?

I agree that imms should be able to see kingdom channels
with out being in that kingdom.  
 
I think that kingdoms should have a king/leader and then
several generals who can also recruit but are like the 
right and left hands of the king that way it solves
the problem that recruits and things can not be 
done without the king on.  Also these
generals also should have access to the top kingdom
skills as well,
 
There should be a limit on generals like 3 max per kingdom

Kingdoms with several rank ones were discussed at length by
the kingdom committee and we eventually decided not to allow them
for several reasons.  Mostly because it is always a disaster but
also because of the skills issue.  We can take another look at this
if you are real serious about it though.
    Kingdom rank on who isn'
ack isn't a bad idea now that we need to watch the ranks more carefully.
   I do think there is some virtue in leaving the kingdom channels semi-
private so please explain why you would want them not to be.

1: We should be able to see kingdom rank on 'who.'
   Sound as a good idea i will add it to the list of stuff
   i have to do but it will not be high on the list
 
2: We should be able to hear talk on kingdom channels
   without being in the kingdom.
   Sound ok i will add it to wiznet as a flag but,
   it will be amnin+ only i see no reson to all immortals
   allowed to read kingdom channels.
 
 
We should consider the concept of having kingdoms with
multiple leaders.  Currently, a kingdom with several 
people in rank 1 would have a significant advantage oer
over* a kingdom with one leader, because they would have
more people who have access to several kingdom skills.
Should this be legal? Or what?
I think it 100% ok to have the number you have on all on a rank as
the kingdom see fit a king/leader, i will even say multi leader
is ok for some kingdoms

Text
I just thought that i'd mention to you, though you prolly already
know this, that the Lankford eq is too high in level.  There are
other pieces that are better and can be used at lower levels,
effectively making it so no one bothers wearing it.  The other
half of this problem is that by the time you are high enough level
to kill the mobs that most are as difficult at least as a lot of
the Drakyri mobs, you can wear the eq from enchanted realms, or
from Realms of Delusion, or, in some extreme casses, from Drakyri.
The whole point of this is tha perhaps drakyri should be altered
into an area good for mid ranges (40-60) to go hunt for xp, and
for eq.

Subject my quest~
Text
Let's get some things straight here.  First of all, I still
WEAR the holy symbol and the vial.  There is no way you could
have removed them from me.  These quests are in a series of
my creation.  I would have appreciated it if you would have
consulted me first before using my themes and items from my
quests in your roleplaying.  You showing roleplaying is good,
and i encourage it, but here's how things will have to work
in order for me to 'play along' with this.
 
First, you will have to tell me where you are going with this.
I already have plans for what I was going to do with the objects,
and unless your plan is much, much better than what I had planned,
I cannot see myself promoting it, or saying it is authentic, since
I will still be wearing the 2 items on my person.
Second, if you change anything in the future, i will require
a note, written to myself.  The themes you have mentioned have
been brought out of my imagination, I have created them.  And
as I am sure you are the same way about things you have created,
or thought up, I am jealously possessive of my ideas.
 
If you do not understand anything in this, have questions about
it, or feel I am out of line, note myself or the admins respectively.
But I do not feel my requests are unreasonable.

Greeting citizen,
 
We ,of the honorable kingdom of Aldon, descided to share
with the rest of the population of Thera our improvement in magic since 
the apocalyspe. After the apocalyspe magic almost been lost in the mind
of a lot of people but Aldon was born and we improved the magic in  all 
his side, the healing of the cleric is becoming stronger,the mage spells
are incresing in power and the prodigys mind a become bigger then ever.
Even us Aldonnian found a way to increase our healing power of almost
the double by trnaforming ourself and devoloped a new style of trance
that make us heal our mind power 2 time faster that normal.
 
Its only the beginning of a great revolution in all kind of magic,
progress is what will make the realm stronger, its what will make thing
change in our life.
 
We are looking forward in the futur to invent new thechnique of magic
to improve our lifes, to make us feel better, more comfortable and
improve our life style.
 
Warlock Kazin of Aldon.
 
==============================================================

I agree that kingdom chat should be private, because I
dont think imms should go around censoring kingdom chat
or regulating it in any way. Thats the job of the king.
If a person doesnt like the way the players talk over
a kingdom channel, they should leave the kingdom.
 
However, I *do* believe that if we can "snoop" the kingdom
chat that our chances of catching illegal promotions would
increase. Derkec, you mentioned that we'd have a problem
with tracking this, and having access to these channels is
one of a very small number of ways I think we can combat
the problem.

Dear imms.
 
Sorry for writing all the time, but this time, i'm very fustraded.
Two weeks ago, takahashi came to me and kill me, for no reason.
he god slayed and i could only get 1/4 of my eq back. Today, Sylias
came up to me and killed me.. i never even spoke to him. And stole 
most of my stuff. I don't even know him.. This is stupid.. i think
you understand. People usually quit fate and go on other muds when
this kind of stuff happen. (e.g. Tulkas) He deleted. That's how 
not alot of people play fate. I really really wish people like that
would get severly punished.. its stupid to come up to someone, kill
him, have no good pk reason, and that person only gets back 
like 1/4 of what he lost.. the worse thing, is it happened to me one
once i mean, and it happened again!. But now, i lost most of my quest
stuff, and all the rest is maxed. Oh.. and i'm writing to just to
tell you that its like 5 minutes ago that he pked me, so you count the

This is wierd, because i never spoke to him. 
And the rest of his note, is a nice little well

works like this:
 
1. a player requests a piece of eq from a mob.  even if
   they don't get it, the piece goes to inventory.
 
2. the player puts the mob to sleep with sleep spell,
   strangle, blackjack, or whatever method.
 
3. regardless of class or the limit on the piece of eq,
   that player can steal from the mob, getting a free
   piece of eq even if it's maxed, no matter what level
   it is.
 
this steal bug also works on players.  any class can
hang out at the healer and steal from people when they
sleep.

its is in ur eyes that i was tried unjustly. 
I knew i wasnt lying when i saw paladar try to do that.

Subject My Story.~
Text
It all started when i came back home, yes, i was a bit
stoned ;p. Well, Galadan was a bit stoned too (he was at his house)
We know our passwords, for no real reason, we're just best friends
and it doesn't matter because we won't steal or do some stupid 
stuff with our chars. When i logged on paladar, i realized he 
changed my password (i just talked to him today, and he told me
he changed it so i won't do any stupid stuff with my char.) 
So, i couldn't go on paladar, so i logged on Altherion. Then,
a big story occured between me, dresc and gage. They were after
me, and when i saw gage, i charmed him. With me alt, 
(altherion, don't forget) So, i looked at him, and saw his vampire
blades, (there's just 1 in the game) so you know what i did.
I type 'order gage rem all' and then, 'order gage give vamp paladar'
I didn't realize i was playing with altherion. i thought i was
still paladar (because most of the time, i play with paladar) 
So i accidently put the paladar when i ordered him. 
My deductions are that kazmir checked the logs and saw what i 
typed, and thought i was multyplaying. But i wasn't, it was 
just a misstype, and paladar wasn't even online when i charmed
him. You can check the logs, i'm pretty sure. 
 
There is something else i wish to discuss with you, and kazmir 
knows of it well. Sylias pk'ed me like 3 days ago, and wrote his
note 40 minutes before his time ran out. He was in time, but his
note Totally sucked, his reason was poor and the rest was just 
how he killed me. Kazmir realized that, and he balefired Sylias,
but then, put him back and gave him 3 days to write a VERY good 
note to kazmir. I agree, that it was a good descision, but what
would happen with me? i lost almost all my equipement because of
someone that his note wasn,t even good. I heard Conrad told me he
would give me my equipement back, not the limited stuff. I agree
with him too, but it hurts me alot, because some guy who's note
isn't even good, messed all my stuff. Its like i was penalized
for this.. I didn't do a thing and i lost equipement. I hope you
understand.

The bottom line here is that you were under the influence
of drugs and were sharing passwords. Sharing passwords,
I know, is extremely stupid and the rules tell the players
DONT DO IT over and over, and yet people keep doing it.
I have very little patience when people say "well we're
friends and we wont fuck each other over" and then use
that as an excuse when they come to me telling me a story
about how they got fucked over.
 
My problem with the balefire is that, and I have a hunch
the logs will confirm this, Paladar wasnt actually mutli-
playing or EQ transferring.  If his reason for charimg Gage
was legit, and I'd like to see a pk/rp note on that, then
I'd advise the council to reverse the decision to balefire
Paladar.

Subject War~
Text
To those new members Mordukhan have accepted I'll just state
some simple orders you must always follow during war.
 
1. Never accept a duel nomatter if its 1 vs 1. Easiest way to
get ambushed and gangbanged.
 
2. Never ever hang around in Sanaria unless its to buy food etc.
or to kill someone, and always be wraithform when doing so.
(same goes for other big areas such as NT)
 
3. Never notewrite of noteread in or in the vicinity of any large
areas, and always be wraith when doing either.
 
4. Do not attempt to level during wars, as that is basically asking
to get jumped and attacked while not ready and weak.
 
5. Never ever join Arena battles during war, as this makes you very
vulnerable, as you arent wraith or spelled up when you return. It
can also be a problem that some spels stick after arena making you go
out of wraith.
 
6. Be paranoid and never put too much trust in anyone not in Mordukhan,
as those who maybe arent in Argus can still be hired or be allies not
yet engaged in full-scale war.
 
7. IF it is at all possible, screw honor and gangbang your targets, as
we are in this to win, and not to risk anything by proving ourselves
superior in 1 vs. 1 battles.

I agree that we should be carefull especially around members
of Narssius, as it is a known fact that Caldon and Marco are
both personal friends of Quolat and Elecial.
As for slaying those members aiding in your brothers downfall,
I suggest we wait with dragging Narssius into the war untill we
are 100% sure what their intentions are.
Should Narssius be brought into this war caused by an attack from
us it would meen that especially in the low lvls 15-50 we would
be seriously outnumbered, which is not desireable.
Should Narssius start acting hostile towards us though, I will have
no second thoughts about declaring war and unleashing a full-scale
attack on them.

what's right, what's wrong, what sucks, what is overpowered,
what should be added, what should be removed, etc etc. The
only rules of the meeting being to behave yourself and not
contribute stupid things. You guys try to keep order, and
attempt to make things run smoothly, well guess what it does
not work on this mud. Instead all it does is waste time listening
to ppl argue back and forth and nothing ever gets accomplished
usually. So just listen to what ppl have to say in person,
make a decision based on that and leave it at that. If someone

Subject Kingdom RP, PK reasons, insanity RP etc. etc.~
Text
Well..Like it can be seen in notes, war between Argus and
Mordukhan has broken again. This time due to Elecial aiding
Tyrin in killing Aztaroth supposedly because he was hired to
do so.
 Elecial's reason is that he needed the money for food and water
because he was too poor to take care of himself.
Knowing very well that Argus accounts are almost bursting with
cheaty gold, this reason is questionable. On top its rather odd
and remarkable to see a high-ranking officer in a balancer-kingdom
hireing his services as an assassin to anyone he pleases. This
pk reason is also questionable.
 
Tyrin managed to pull off the ancient insanity RP nicely by posting
a single note with a few ramblings before killing Aztaroth. On top
he sorta shot himself in the food by being his same old good self
conquering an area for gondor earlier the same day. thus his PK
reason is also remarkably questionable, as Insanity PK-reasons have
already earlier been punished in cases like Nayru, Sylias etc.
So unless both these people can  actually produce just a somewhat
fair reason for killing Aztaroth, and thus causing yet another
tiresome war without any obvious reason, Id like the Admin of RP
and the Admin of Kingdoms to finally step in and actually request
some fair RP.
 
The constant wars that seemingly always seem to land in Mordukhans
lap are becomming tiresome. Their lack of RP and reasons other than
stupid OOC ones have made them hollow, and have even reached the point
where they beging to destroy the game for some of us.
I have hardly lvl'ed, quested or RP'ed the last 2 months because I was
forced to fight another stupid war with Argus and Gondor, and the
second I actually manage to end this war and bring a little peace and
development around on the mud for the 2 kingdoms, Aztaroth gets fucked
over, and another unreasonable war is started by people who's RP cant
even support the war they're starting.
 
Im getting sick of this...
 
 
Azazel has begun to wonder if this mud is worth the time and effort.

notes must be written within 48
staff may punish as harshly as they see fit, up to a slay and

In help Rules
   Do NOT reveal any alts, dead or alive.  You will be punished
   harshly.  Alt revealing includes your own alts or any alts
   belonging to another person.
 
This is givibg troble, along with the poor rp on this mud
Only few can play 2 diff rp woth chars
 
And when you then try to get in to a kingdom with you alt
When ppl can't talk of alts is they no way to know if it alt or
a real person.
 
I think we need to removoe it
 
I will bet it give other troble as well, ie.
  I know Dation did backstap my kingdom when he joind it,
   And Now he is trying to become frinds with me with his alt
  To join the kingdom ones more, after what he i will never trust him
 
 Dation is not real char, and i did just make to this case

We must stay in numbers and not stray alone,reasons being

We will need to finish the last of the mordukhan generals off.
and that would be vaezeron.

  Gentlemen, the question is simple.  What do we have to do to make this
game funner for those of us who roleplay well and MUCH LESS FUN for
those who don't?
 
 
   I asked Kazmir today what needed to be done to fix our mud, he said
to delete 50% of the players.  THAT is my intention here.  RPers party,
non-rpers decide to go to another mud.  (This will also save on the 
limited eq problem.

  One idea is to limit experiance.  This might get things going among
the lowbies  We define some quantity, rp points.  We reccommend getting
X points per level.  Then we multiply all experiance gains by the
player's points / level.  No points, no experiance, Lots of points go
ahead and level on the fidos.

Subject How to make this mud better~
Text
  Okies folks, Derkec asked me to summarize some ideas I
had for making this mud better.....
 
  1.Cleanup-First and foremost, we gotta get the crap ass
    players who just wanna pk/annoy/ and basically do as
    they please, cuz they think rping is dumb, outta here.
  2.Get Tough-Imms Gotta stiffen up and start getting tough
    with people who whine constantly about not being strong
    enough, not having this or that skill/spell, not being
    as good as that class, or this class, or whatever.
  3.Cooperation-Big one here, we need EVERYONE, who wants this
    to be a true RP mud to start cooperating and working
    towards that end.  This means player your characters
    as your characters, not as yourself, and if you have
    alts, play them as seperate entities!!!!
  4.Helping Hand-Help out the new players who maybe aren't
    as good at rping or haven't established themselves yet.
    And help out the oldies who don't rp, yet are the highest
    level cuz they know the mud inside and out.
   5.RP, RP, RP-When you talk, Talk IC, when you ask questions,
     ask IC, when you're going to go slaughter mobs, say
     it IC.
 
 
 
   Believe me people, this can work, I've seen it work.  For
those people who don't, goto Mudconnector and look for Avendar,
It's a rom code mud with LOTS of tweeks.  It's also a heavy RP
mud that balances Pking beautifully.  The only reason I don't
play it is because I love fate, and I think it's the best mud
I've ever played....But....It could be better...
 
  We'll be discussing this stuff soon with some admins, so think
up ideas on ways to make this work....

Text
would be fine except for the problem of telling when
someone rps and noone is on, or no one is monitoring.
Here is a possible solution: create a StartRp command
and EndRp command.  That way if someone starts Rping
you know to log what the person says or to have someone
go wizi. . .  Otherwise you will need some poor soul 
to sit on and wait for someone to actually rp, and 
currently I could see that as a very boring job or at
least how Fate currently is.  Some of my other ideas
can't take place until the climate starts to shift.

The changes need to be made slowy otherwise everyone

to get use to each new thing at a time.  for instances
if the commands go into effect give a week, and the levels
require rp points give time before you move on to the next
 
thing.  Moving to quickly can be just as bad as not doing

Also as far as whoever suggested the idea of showing your

   I think we are still in the throwing ideas out on the
table stage folks.  And yes, the experiance dependant on
rp could only be implemented as a part of a broader system.
   However, I think that anything we do to incite complaining
and anger has certain benifit.  I want people to quit.  I want
people to tell their friends, "Man, that fate of kingdoms sucks -
all they want to do is rp."  I want a serious change in player
base in the next few months.
   What I don't want to do is badly offend our good players and
my good friends.  I want to excite the rpers out there even more
than we anger the non-rpers.  Is this insane?
 
Derkec
  I'd forgotten - Strict RP rules are something that I would like
to avoid.  Encouraging rp and requiring some effort in certain places
(like PK) now, is the goal.  And yes, everything is subject to 
judgement, but I expect we'll give some sort of credit for saying
Anything over the gossip channel.

Yea rp on the mud does need some work. I dont really have

If ya gonna toss the non-rpers away, give them demarits for
every other day they dont use rp. So it can take a little
harder for them to level.Hmm, yea ya had a good idea about
that stuff.
 
You can also just give them no-ooc, so they can only talk in

demarits.

 Okay Marco's body has now been taken over by my old char
Kaiser's soul. (Like I suggested would happen in my other
note.) Poor Marco's soul has been torn away from him and
brought to replace Kaiser's in the afterlife. Soon Marco
will make preperations to bring Corwin through the to the
living world ( Hes getting a new computer.. Finally) and
then maybe even Bouchard ( who may get a computer again )
 
 This is just a little thing im trying to do right now so
that theres a little bit of rp for corwin when he comes back
because hes the real great rp. And I wanted to set him up
with something to build on. 
 
 So now when Marco acts very much different its because
he in no longer in control of his body.
 
 Kaiser gained access to Marco's when marco tried to warn
everyone what Tyrin was going to do by speaking, and by
speaking allodu on gossip he gave up the protection of Zelfax
 
 Which was something that me and Caldon had a long rp about.

Subject Why did i adress this to myself too?~
Text
I can name one of the biggest problems facing rp at the
moment - pplayers don't see a benefit to it since they
can level up and develop a character faster by killing
mobs.  And I can attest to that sicne I've made it quite
clear in the past months that I intend to level solely
off of rp and have managed to get 1 complete level, from
58 to 59.  When I tell people this is how I intend to
level, they tell me i'm nuts, i'll never see my best
skills and spells.  This is one of the first things that
needs to change.  For a lot of people, they may enjoy
roleplaying, but as long as there is no incentive to do
it, ie - no benefit over not doing it, they won't.
Suggestions to help?
1) Create an I-Say and an O-say for ic and ooc says.
2) Log ALL I-says, and also emotes, b/c myself and several
   other players use emotes mostly for speaking in character.
3) Have imm's read the logs constantly
4) Perhaps use Salindors idea for the logs.  You timestamp
   them, and then when people say they are starting to rp
   some, the command will give a time, you can just go check
   the time in the logs then, and see who was roleplaying.
5) For number 4, if people lie about starting to rp, dock
   them xp, rather than bonusing it, that'll stop that real quick
6) GIVE OUT REALISTIC XP AMOUNTS.  I can't stress this enough.
   For an evening of roleplaying, I can expect to get, if an
   imm is on, MAYBE 500 xp.  This is bull.  How much you get
   should be determined by length, how many people are involved,
   and should also be based somewhat on your level (ie - lower
   levels need less per level, so get less)
7) Give out rewards OTHER than just xp.  If someone roleplays
   insanely well for, say, a certain item, let them start
   stacking up 'points' for roleplaying about it, and once
   they hit a certain predetermined by the imms but unknown
   to the player amount, they get the item.  (just an example)
   Another idea would be to give them glory points, and put
   things there, such as xp bonuses, tokens to trade in for
   restrings, or even custom eq's.  But no, i take that back,
   don't give glory points.  Make a new point system, quest
   (ack, this editor needs to be like the olc editor) RP points.
   They then trade in their rp points for stuff. Like, say,
   100 pts = 1k xp, 1000 pts = restring, 5000 pts = unique item.
   Stuff like that
8) Get involved yourselves (imms).  If you make yourselves
   available to roleplay, not only can you provide a strong
   example of good roleplaying, you can have fun doing it yourself.
   All imms (except builders who can't get involved anyways) should
   have a very good background and description, and when a player
   asks what a good one would look like, they can simply say 
   'read mine'
 
Ok, this is all for now, though i'm sure I have more.

  I'm sorry but I disagree, the best roleplaying comes from
people who do it, just because they like to.  If all roleplaying
is for, is to get stuff, then the mud will be bombarded by
5000 rp notes, Gossip crap that will flood the screen, and other
junk that will get old fast.  THough I think Certain RP
rewards are ok, I do not believe we should get exp for it.
 
 
  I think we should do away with all global boards except
oops....I mean all Global Channels, except Newbie, which would
be only used by newbies and by high levels to reply 
to them with help.  This makes the mud more realistic in
Terms of Someone can't be heard speakingto another who's
on the opposite side of a city from him.
 
 
  Possible rewards to Rp, Might include eq. if, and only if
the player had been rping for quite some time, and
had stayed consistant in his/her RP....
 
 
  But I think we should stay away from RPING to gain levels...

Fate is a ressurection of the quest tradition; something
where people can get together and work together, or
against each other, towards a goal and reward.
 
As far as xp for roleplaying goes, I fundamentally agree
with Mojo.  If we start giving out huge xp bonuses for
roleplaying, we'll reveal what the players REALLY want,
which is xp; not roleplaying. Although some xp rewards
are reasonable, and I give them out sometimes, I think
they shouldnt be what people are working to get.

Ugh, you misunderstand.  My pointis that people in general
should be given some incentive for roleplaying.  When you
concentrate on roleplaying, there is no way to develope
your character.  As, for example, my gaining 1 level taking
over a month.  People want to both see their characters get
developed, but would also want to do the roleplaying, but
if there is no way to further themselves they won't do it.
And I'm not saying that rewards should be the sole reason
people roleplay, but it is a good way to acknowledge that
yes, we see what you are doing, and we encourage it.  And
you can't do that with a 500 xp bonus that could have been
acheived from spending 5 minutes to kill a single mob.
 
As far as getting rid of the global channels - i say that
is not a solution.  There is no way you can expect everyone
here to be in character every minute of their time spent on
here.  That is an unreasonable goal, it'll never happen.  I
don't agree with the gossip channel, I think that should be
done away with as an acceptable means of roleplaying, but it
should be kept around for things like global announcements,
or if not the gossip channel, then some other form of it.
OOC, however, should stay here.  Perhaps restrict the use
for those who don't roleplay, but even that i think would
be a bad idea.  Sometimes people just want to talk with their
friends, and if there is no ooc channel, they can't do that.
 
I never said that anything i suggested on my note was a
solution, just a possible idea.  I do, however, believe that
you have to motivate people to continue roleplaying, or to
start it in the first place.  Make it clear this is a rp mud
and that roleplaying is involved, that's all fine and dandy,
but if theres no reason to, people will just start finding
ways to cheat the system and get around the roleplaying
facet of gameplay here.

Tyrins RP has now developed to 2 notes, ohhh yes, I know
admins have recieved additional material, but now it seems
Tyrin has developed maybe not his RP, but at least his odd
actions
 
"I sit in Lankford, in the cold, surrounded by evil ones who
themselves are now not so different from me..."  -Tyrin
 
This RP where Tyrin proclaims himself evil doesnt really fit
with this line im recieving on kingdom channel.
 Covenanter A MORDUKHAN WitchElf: Darnok's Keep is being attacked!!!
 
It seems as if Tyrin has developed his Evil RP towards not only
killing members from evil kingdoms, but also routing their areas.
It somehow strikes me as odd that it is exactly evil Mordukhan
guardians Tyrin chose to kill, and not halflings in Shire.
 
Could it be that there is an earlier unmentioned agenda in Tyrins
RP?...Could it be that only Mordukhan will ever be the target of
this so-called RP?...Does Tyrins RP even midly serve as a proper
fullfilling foundation for killing our guardians?...Could it be
that Tyrin is maybe friends with people disliking Mordukhan?...
Could it be that Tyrins RP was hastily created to serve the one
purpose of hurting mordukhan?...Who might benefit from dead Mord
guardians?..Howcome he is so fixated on hitting Mordukhan?...
Is his RP really so narrow that it doesnt involve anyone but himself,
Elecial and Mordukhan?...Im puzzled...please do try enlighten me.

I would like to file an official complaint about cheating

and refer to the written fate rules as to where the cheating
lies.
 
I quote Conrad from his note(note 75, board 4)
Hrm "For those of you who want to know why Vorphalack was
killing you, the answer is that he is the alt of a certain
person (Aztaroth) who is whining that I am not punishing
Tyrin for killing him for a reason he finds unacceptable."
 
The rules broken with what he wrote here are the rules about
alt revealing which you can find stated in "help rules"
 
I quote the help file named "help rules".
 
Hrm "Do NOT reveal any alts, dead or alive.  You will be punished
harshly.  Alt revealing includes your own alts or any alts
belonging to another person."
 
 
To write it short, I am on behalf of Aztaroth filing an complaint
about Conrad disregarding and breaking the rules about alt-revealing
as they are described in official fate rules help file.

Subject A summation of some problems, the need for a judgement call.~
Text
I am sorry to bother you with this complaint, but after
several attempts at sorting things out with Conrad without
going around him I have given up.
This cannot be written using Kazmir's rules of complaints,
as there are few written, and enforced RP rules. You can
chose to view this note as whineing and punish me, or you
can chose to follow my request and make a judgment call to
settle things once and for all.
 
I'll try to summarize the problem as shortly as possible.
 
Tyrin started some RP on board 2 with a single note. His
note was rather cryptic, but could in general be viewed as
a note describing him starting to go insane. Very shortly
after writing his short note, he hired Elecial to help kill
Aztaroth, and they suceeded in doing so.
We were all very puzzled by this PK as we could not read
anything out of Tyrins note explaining anything about hate
towards Mordukhan or its members, so we allerted Conrad that
we found it fishy and outside rules for Tyrin to make this
PK with only one short cryptic RP note as reason.
Conrad hastily told us to quit complaining as he had recieved
a note from Tyrin explaining some secret RP/reason for the PK.
It has later through rumors come to my attention that Tyrin and
Elecials reason might be something abt a not yet approved of
kingdom idea, but I cannot get this confirmed as Conrad believes
it to be perfectly OK to only direct RP towards the Admin of RP,
and leave the rest of the mud without knowledge of the RP and
thus without any chance of RP'ing back at Tyrin. We all found
it to smell kinda rotten to be allowed a not approved Kingdom
idea combined with 1 short note to be sufficient PK-reason and
RP for a good-alignment elf to go insane and murder whoever he
pleases, and even more worried because it seems as if only the
members of mordukhan are targets in this narrow RP. Tyrin has
later proceeded to kill our area guardians, also without noting
or gossiping any reasons, and still conrad lets it pass saying
Tyrin can act as he pleases without RP'ing with Mordukhan abt
it, only explaining himself to the Admin of RP.
I believe this way of handling things is hurting RP on fate, as
it serves to remove RP away from the players, making it impossible
to reply or make sence in peoples actions. Basically with this new
approach to RP, all PK notes and RP notes could be directed to
Admins making the 2 boards empty, removing foundation for any RP
at all...Rp would die.
As this is a game, certain rules have to be present to secure that
the general gameplay isnt destroyed for some players. One of the
rules I miss being enforced is people RP'ing thoroughly before
engaging in PK's, and with Conrads new system where PK-reasons can
be forever kept hidden, it will leave some ppl dead and naked with
them not knowing why. I think that is unacceptable. It might be
realistic, but it is hurting the aspect of roleplaying your
character personality and alignment, because you can forever keep
it secret and thus keep it impossible for anyone to roleplay towards.
Conrad seems to be 100% disagreeing to this, and merely threatens me
with punishment should I not stop asking, complaining and questioning
the correctness of the approach he has chosen.
In the meenwhile Tyrin carries on with threatening our members and
killing our guardians while we still dont know why.
It seems to me as if Tyrin has finally invented the miracle RP for
PK-hungry players. The RP that requires no notes and no gossip exept
saying "I do not need to explain myself to you", but in the same time
provides unlimited access to PK'ing whoever he likes...Bouchard would 
have been jealous.
 
I need a judgement call giving a clear YES/NO, considering the aspect
of RP, PK, and PK-reason to hidden from all players, and only visible
to Admins. I need a clear YES/NO considering Tyrins current RP and
PK-reason telling me if they are ligit or not.
 
 
Azazel, is getting tired...

Subject Argus Kingdom RP. Ignored yes?/no?~
Text
As Mentioned in my earlier note Elecial was aiding Tyrin
in killing Aztaroth, and his reason about needing the
gold he would earn from it was hardly reasonable considering
Argus unlimited amount of gold.
Nevertheless did Elecials actions cause a war to break between
Argus and Mordukhan.
Having read help argus_rp file, I was quite certain it would
be grounds for banishment for Elecial to disobey the orders
about peace Quolat had made just before Elecial attacked
Aztaroth, and because Elecials actions would have made Quolat
look like a liar because Quolat had just settled a peace.
Quolat did write a note saying Elecial was being banished, but
due to what I believe was Quolats character changing ownership
from Shinji/Fieres to Kaiser/Marco, Quolats RP changed 100%.
He ignores his kingdom codex about respect for your superiors,
he ignores or doesnt even know about Quolats earlier promise
to banish Elecial, and has in general turned Quolats IC personality
around 180 degrees.
This seems to me as blatantly disregarding Kingdom RP codex, as
Elecial still holds the same rank in Argus eventhough he has
acted as he has. Also it seems to be the epitome of misery considering
the problems character sharing brings up, as you DONT trade off
the leader of a kingdom and then change his personality 100%
unless you RP it thoroughly on boards and gossip.
 
This I have also talked to Conrad about, but yet again I feel
as if i do not any favor in his eyes, and he has again turned me
down calling me whiny etc etc. But it nevertheless hasnt stopped
me from thinking it is sickening to watch Argus constantly since
it was created either never RP, or when they finally do completely
ignore their own background and codex.
If you want to run a Kingdom, you do not trade off your character,
you DO roleplay, and you DO roleplay according to your kingdoms
background, alignment, codex and ethics.
Conrad appearently disagrees and has yet again refused to listen
 he has refused to even advising Argus, and he has refused to
make a ruling in this whole discussion.
Yet again Im left wondering wtf is going on, and yet again I have
to watch RP being raped without any chance of stopping it.
 
I ask for a judgement call from you telling me clearly if trading
off a character that is leading a kingdom causing his RP to change
100% is legal YES/NO?.
And I ask that you make a ruling in this matter telling me if Argus
is following their own RP to a satisfactory degree, or if you also
see it as a problem having them never RP and ignoring their codex
when they finally do so YES/NO?
 
Should you agree to my 2 notes considering Conrad making wrongfull
judgements hurting RP, I ask that you please step in and act to
stop it, cuz it has begun to frustrate some of us immensely.
This also goes for Conrad revealing alts on public channels which
I have mentioned in earlier note.

OK, this is how it was.. We heard our kingdom guardians
in Darnok's keep yelling that we were under attack, both
me and Malgorian ran there to check it out, Tyrin admitted
on gossip that it was him doing it. We had 3 guardians at
entrance and one in the southwest tower (Tyrin had prolly
killed other 2 in tower like yesterday) The 3 guardians
at entrance were all intact, but the one in southwest tower
was at small but discusting cuts. Like 10 min later,
Our kingdom guardians cried for help again, I typed where,
noticed that Tyrin was in the tower, then I yelled 
"screw u, u fucknut", then typed where again, Tyrin was gone.
It was MAX 3-4 secs between Tyrin attacking guardian, and when
he was gone again. I then ran over to the guardian to check
and the guardian was GONE. I mean, not even Tyrin would kill
a kingdom guardian at small cuts in 2 secs. Its definately
something fishy about this..
 
I then copied down the system time like maybe 2 min after,

    Reading about your kingdom's goals and being fairly familiar
with the design of Argus, I am dissapointed in the rp that I see.
Most obviously, that there isn't much of it.  The upper ranks are far
more concerned with their own agenda's than that of thier kingdom, and
its been a long time since a war started with Argus, that had anything
to do with protecting a weak kingdom.
   Come on guys, your kingdom was going to be named 'Guardian' before
the admin staffed declared that name too lame.  Here's the deal:
   Really impress me with rp, or a skill or two will disappear.  Piss
me off with more poor rp, and lots of skills go poof.  I also suggest
that Elecial find a new title or a new kingdom.  An 'angel of death' 
has no business in Argus, and even less business as the Kingdom
Ambassador.  Come to think of it, I'll need to check my sources, but
I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to have a brute as an
ambassador, we'll see.
 
Impress me gentlemen.

So far the only kingdom that needed our protection was Gondor
who asked for us to protect them from Mordukhan and we did.
That was the last war. It was a few weeks ago.
 
This upcoming war is its own bussiness, but none of that is
really poor rp, think if Elecial did that and Quolat was a real
king, he wouldn't be banished. Mordukhan stayed in hiding until
we decided we would let the war end non-violently. And that the
Mords were beaten. Now Elecial ( Basically the second in command
of Argus) kills a long time Argus enemy allmost our kingdoms worst.
Well we still ahve the taste for blood.
 
We might be guardians but we are still human, what else would

   A balance?
 
   Lets face it, upper level levelling sucks.  It just isn't a
whole lot of fun.  That's why I did what imrahil is doing now.  The
levelling only from rp bit.  He should feel lucky, I got 50 exp total.
 
   Maybe we give characters above level 50, the option of going RP.
When we do this, we flip a flag on their char and don't let them
gain exp from killing monsters and such.  They would only get exp
from roleplaying and perhaps player killing.
 
 
One more time:
   You guys are catching on to half of my original question.  you've
started telling me what we need to do to excite rpers about this
mud.  Noone has really suggested a good way to get the worst of worst
rpers to leave.

  Vorph has an interesting case, so I am going to grant him
an appeal.  You folks know the drill.  Vorph, you owe me one note
describing your case that your pk was within legitamate rp grounds
even though it looked like a stupid bad pk to us.  Conrad, You
have the responsibility of the prosecutor and owe us one note stating
your case.
    The council will research the case in the meantime.  I will take
responsibility for setting a date on when we vote.  
 
Btw, The last appeal is dead since Kazmir overruled himself.
 
Derkec, Your Friendly Head of Council

    Conrad, you were quiet out of line revealling the alt
of Aztaroth = Vorphalack on a public board.  I took the step
of removing the note to minimize the damage.  
   First, I would like to apologize for putting you in the 
position that we did.  There is no way we should have given
you all the responsibilities and powers that we did all at
one time.  Not surprizingly, you developed the hero complex
that most of this staff has had at one time or another.
   You are acting like you are on some noble quest to fix
this mud, right the wrongs and make the planet safe for
democracy.  In a sense, that is nice to see, but it is out
of the scope of what we want,need or ask you to do.
   We need to realize that we usually don't have the whole
story, nor the broadest perspective.  That goes for everyone
here, especially myself.  Always before a slay and loot (or
at least the redistribution part) try to get someone else
in the council to back you.
   Next pointer, Don't write notes that have say lots of
things like, "I have decided" or "I have the right."  Your
alt revealling note made it sound like you in your sole descretion
decided that Tyrin's rp was acceptable.  This puts you out on
a ledge to be shot at and the rest of us get bombarded with
requests to reign in the renegade admin.  Come from the
arguement that the council (or some of us on council) has
decided ______.  That way, if we are shown to be wrong,
we can reverse our decicion without anyone looking like a
jerk or a fool.  In general, relax and take care of things
in a non-adversarial manner.  Slay and loot, but do so in
a, "Sorry I have to do this, but I have to. And your eq will
be safe with me pending the review of the council." manner.
 
  Anyway, now we have to decide what to do about your alt-revealing.
Frankly, we should fire you, but you show way too much promise for
me to be eager to go that route.  I welcome suggestions from
the entire council on what to do in this situation.  If we don't
come to a consensus, I'll take full responsibility for the decision
of the majority.

I think my answer is, you make the cool shit unaccesable
to the worst-rpers.  Things like special prestige classes
that are only avialable to rpers, xp to make up for not
killing mobs(this may sound funny saying it, but currently
rping is a way to punish yourself, so give xp for it) a
good job on rping learning how to use a skill(I mean like
finding someone that can act like they are using the item
and make it so you can do the same(or over time you learn
how to use the item) item=skill(dumb me), giving special
eq to those that can roleplay the creation of it.  
By doing all this (and showing rped characters are inheriently
better than non-rped characters) non-rpers will either be
unable to compete with rpers or will do something stupid and
get balefired.

   I removed the note, and the process of reviewing what he
did is underway.  Also, I restored channels and notes to Vorph.
I'm also going to get on Tyrin's case.
 
-Damn doing this job in a non-shitty way is really hard.

  Both of you have help the RP Admin title recently, so I'll take
permission from either of you.  I would like to declare Argus out
of bounds in a rping well.  This would result in loss of skill(s).
  I would also like to punish Elecial for acting outside of the
kingdom's codex and demote him a few ranks.
 
For both of these actions, I need the permission of the kingdom
-ack- RP admin.  I will accept the permission of either of you.

   This is entirely inappropraite to share with you, so please
don't let it go further than us, but Argus' skills are under

There is a bug with the scroll of identify. 
It doesn't want to id the item when you recite it.
It says:
 
You recite a scroll of identify.
 
 
And nothing happens.
