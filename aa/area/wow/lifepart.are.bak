The Lower Class Dining Room~
This particular room was made for the common man, as you can tell
by the lack of money put into the furniture.  The tables have no
sheets to cover them, the candles themselves sit in the middle of the
table and make leave wax everywhere.  The floor is very dirty and
covered in rotten food and spilled ale.  The waiters are little human
boys, barely able to keep your order straight.

The Upper Class Dining Room~
As you enter the room, you are awed at the elegance of it.  The
tables are covered in silk sheets, the utensils are made of gold and
platinum, the candles on the walls gleam proudly and brightly.  Well
dressed waiters and waitresses hustle to and from the room with
orders.  In the corner of the room, a small band plays gentle,
relaxing music.

The Kitchen~
The smell of delicious food fills your nostrils as you enter the
kitchen.  Along the walls there are numerous stoves, ovens, and
sinks.  Fires leap from the stoves and steam rises from the sinks as
the cooks prepare some of the most tasty looking food you have ever
layed your eyes on.  You'd best leave quickly, or the cook may make
you wash the dishes.

Behind the Bar~
Golden and silver mugs line the counter along the backside of the
bar, some needing to be cleaned and some ready to be filled.  Barrels
full of Ale and Mead sit there also, right next to bottles of
numerous alcoholic beverages.  Pictures of other bars and even some
of epic battles line the walls.  There is a hallway leading to a room
behind the bar.

Within the Storage Room~
You are standing within the Storage Room, accessible usually only
by the Bartender himself.  It is quite chilly within the room, in
order to keep the food and drink from going to waste.  The stone
walls are lined with shelves upon shelves full of all sorts of Ale
and Mead.  Strong, wooden boxes are piled in the corner and seem to

The Commons Room~
This room is full of many different couches of many different
sizes.  Some are for much larger races, others are for very small
races.  A fire place glows dimly along the eastern wall.  Maids walk
to and from the room, offering to bring food and drink to anyone
relaxing within.  A pretty young lady sits calmly behind a window
waiting to help a customer find a room.

A Hallway~
The walls of this hallway are decorated with very special pictures
of numerous beautiful sights throughout Thera.  One shows blue water
cascading down a waterfall, another shows a stary night as soon from
Mount Kintane, and yet another depicts the city of Sanaria from afar.
The carpets is made of very fine, red silk and has an intricate
repeating diamond shape down the middle.

The Staircase~
You have reached a staircase, a rather grand staircase.  The black
iron stairs spiral upwards to the second floor bedrooms.  The hand
rail is made of gleaming silver.  At bottom and top of the of the
hand rail are silver lions hands, used to help the feeble onto the
first stair.  They glare around the room and seem to be watching
everything.  There is a carpet on the floor that seems to be covering
something and there is also a door to your right.

An old, worn hallway~
This hallway is very old, as you can tell from the torn wallpaper
and cobwebs that cover the ceiling.  It hasn't been repaired for
quite some time, not that it really matters.  The rug that once
covered the floor is now torn to shreds and needs to be thrown out. 
North of here the horses can be heard stamping about their stalls,
along with the barking of an occasional dog.

You stand before large, wooden gates.  Patches of straw lay
everywhere, and the stench of large animals is all about you.  Above
the door the words "Stable" are carved.  Over the years, it appears
that age has gotten the best of the stable.  Everything looks like it

Forest~
{gThe density of all these trees is frightening and allows very
little light to pass through.  This Forest look incredibly old and
untouched, but never a hint of fragile.  Tall, mighty oaks tower high
above you.  Along with Maple, Spruce and Birch.  The ground is
covered with green grass along with strange and exotic flora of a
time that is long forgotten...  The scent of this forest feels,
although calming, like a force of Nature...  There is something out
there that intensively follows your every movement.  A few Strange
noises from animals, of fine tuned perception, in the distance,
alarms of your prescence.  There seems to be left no room to move in
along the density of trees and shrubs, except from moving North or
South.  There is one tall Birch tree that seems to be fearly easy to
climb up.  {x

Up in a Birch Tree.~
{gThe white bark with its black rifts looks beautiful on this
massive Birch.  Between all the strong branches you can spot the
ground below.  However the rest of the Forest is hidden by its
density.  The eon year old scent of the tree feels clear and strong,
like the essence of something Powerfull.  This forest is teeming with
life and animals in the distance alarms the others of your presense. 
One of the branches has some sort of inscription on it.  Climbing
down looks like the only directional option to move.  {x

Forest~
{gThis spot within this old Forest seems a bit open, but overgrown
with strange and exotic flora of a time that is long forgotten... 
Green moss along with beautiful plants entangle the massive trees and
there is quite a mixture of trees that tower above the ground in this
Forest.  There are mighty Oaks, steadfast Maples, evergreen Spruce
and colossal Birches.  The Fauna is florushing here too and noises
that are aware of your presence can be heard in the distance.  The
strong scent of the Eon old trees that grows here radiates mystical
prowess and old wisdom.  Movement does not seem to be inhibited in
any direction, but the Forest does grow denser further away from
here.  {x

The First Mate's Quarters~
Many personal affects of the first mate, can be seen neatly placed about the
room. A small armoire rests against the wall, with a few artifacts lying on it,
from distant lands.  A small hammock is nailed from one wall to another,
swaying bakc and forth with the ship.  A few maps of distant lands, hang
from the ship's wall. A door to the east, leads to the ship's stern.

Climbing from the Ship's Mast~
A strong rope, drops down from the Crow Nest of the ship.  The
ship's sails are all about, hanging from the ship's yard.  Below,
the entire ship can be seen.  Tightly kept, and well scrubbed.  The
yard of the ship is just a bit further up the mast, and the Crow's Nest
lying beyond the yard.

Further up the Ship's Mast~
A strong rope, drops fown from the Crow Nest, not too much farther
up the mast.  The ship's yard, crosses the mast a few arm-lengths up
the mast, with the ship's sails hanging from the yard, engulfing all
directions in white.  The ship's deck rests a short distance below.

The ship's yard and mast meet here, crossing each other perpendicularly.
The ship's sail hang far below, from the ship's yard.  The Crow Nest is a small
bit further up the mast, accessible thanks to a strong rope hanging from it,
far below to the ship's deck.

The Crow's Nest~
A spectacular view can be seen, in all directions, as far as the eye
can see, to the horizon.  The sky seems so close, that one could reach
out with their hand, and grab at it.  Below, the ship's sails hang from
the yard, in a marvelous manner, stretching out to the ship's deck, which
lies very far below.  A rope hangs from the Crow's Nest, following the mast
down to the ship's deck.

The Yardarm~
The Yardarm, portrudes north and south, from the ship's mast.  A
wise estimate would be, that it stands at least a hundred paces above
the deck of the ship.  The ship's sails, a beautiful white material,
hand-knitted by master tailor's, to ensure it had the greatest of strength,
are tied to the yardarm here with many entricate knots.  The sails
hang down towards the deck of the ship, strapped here and there, to
ensure it catches the greatest amount of wind.  The mast is accessible,
following the yardarm to the south.

The Bridge of the Ship~
Wonderfully hand-carved, well-polished railings surround
what must be the bridge of the ship.  From the Captain's post, an overview
of the entire ship can be had.  With the exception of the ship's stern.  It's
view being blocked by the Captain's Quarters.  The wheel of the ship
stands in the midst of the bridge, seemingly carved with the utmost care, and
perfect precision.  Beautiful hand-crafted stairs to the west, will take you
back to the ship's deck.

The Captain's Quarters~
A low ceiling, gives insult to otherwise, a very cozy and comfortable room.
A large, nicely-kept bed lies in the corner.  The room seems decorated
with items and belongings from many foreign locations.  A bundle of
navigatory maps lay at the foot of the bed, next to the Captain's desk.
A window looks out eastward, over the ship's stern, while a door leads
west back to the ship's bridge.

The Gunnery's Storage Room~
A sulfuric stench haunts this room.  Small burlap sacks resting all about
this small, stench-drenched rooms, give hint to the culprit of the stench.
Gunpowder, and lots of it, is stored within this room, inside the sacks.
A large pile of cannonballs, rests in one corner, some threatening to roll
off the pile and strike something, as the ship sways to and from.  A door
to the east, leads back to the gunnery deck.

A room lies to the west, filled with burlap sacks and cannonballs,
and the smell of gunpowder seems horrendously worse, coming from there.
To the north and south, corners of the gunnery deck can be found, beginning
the western line of cannons.  To the east, lies two sets of stairs.  One
leading up to the ship's upperdeck, the other down into the ship's bunker.

This deck of the ship, is a very dark, and cool deck.  This is
the lowest deck of the ship, consisting of the crew's bunker and
mess hall.  This deck rests below the sea-level, and is kept
a bit cooler than the gunnery deck and surface deck, due to the cooler
temperature of the ocean.  Lying in the southwestern corner
of the ship's bunker, bunk beds lie before you, and following the edge
of the room northward.  To the northeast, a single set of stairs
can be seen, leading up to the gunnery deck.  And to the east of
those stairs, the scent of the ship's mess hall lingers.

Graveyard Path~
You are moving along the graveyard path.  The air here is very
damp and cold.  The ground here just keeps getting more and more
dead, blighted.  Large iron fences tower to your west and east,
behind them you can see lots of tombstones, and you can barely see
some movement.  You can continue north and south.

Inside an Old House~
You have entered a very old house.  The hinges on the door can
barely hold the rotted wooden door in its place.  Some old wooden
chairs and a small table stand in the middle of the room.  An old
burned-out fireplace is placed in the corner, there is a cauldron in
it.  This looks to be the old home of a Necromancer.

The Second Floor~
The second floor of the house is not any nicer than the first. 
The stairs could barely hold your weight and squeeked like crazy. 
There are a couple pictures on the wall with cut out eyes in them. 
Some of them watches you as you move along the hallway.  There is
little light here, just cold and damp air.

Cross Section in Northern Graveyard~
You are in a cross section in the northern part of the graveyard. 
A cold breeze hits you in the face, chilling your bones.  The ground
here seems to have died, there is nothing but blight on the ground. 
Dry ground, sand and dirt, some bugs crawl on the ground.  You can
spot some trees stripped of leaves, swaying on the wind.  You can
continue south, east and west.  There is a door to your north.

Northeastern Graveyard~
You are walking west towards the end of the northwestern
graveyard.  The air here is same as everywhere in this graveyard,
damp and very cold.  You shiver as a cold breeze hits your face,
colder than usual.  This place sure is creepy.  The dead ground here
is crawling with worms and cockroaches.  Bats fly around, trying to
scare you.  You can go east and west.

Before a grave~
You find yourself standing infront of a very old grave.  All you
can see is a tombstone and some rotted flowers infront of it.  The
ground here is nothing but blight, and as you look over the grave, a
cold wind slowly hits you in the face, you can also hear some
whispers in the air, spooky.

lantern sits on the table.  There is lots of dirt on the floor here.

is somewhat nicer than outside the house, here its slightly warmer
and more dry.  This part of the house also looks old.

raggedy bed in the corner and a small candle is lit on a chair next

pieces of wood in the middle of the room but you cant say that it is
a bed.  The room is very empty, spiderweb cover the walls and the air
in here is very cold and dense.  There is no light at all here.
