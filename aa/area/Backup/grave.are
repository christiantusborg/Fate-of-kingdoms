A road made of metal.~
You are at the base of a huge mountain.  The mountain has two
peaks and the road you are on leads through the center of the
northern and southern peaks.  The road appears to be constructed of
some kind of metal.  The metal, instead of rusting has just become
tarnished throughout the years.  There has been much talk of a
strange structure being discovered on and within My.  Olympus.  This
metal road that you have happened upon is the path to that structure.

A road made of metal~
The rumor that you have heard of an ancient structure being found
is obviously true.  Looking north you can see three large domes
protruding from the earth.  There is one dome standing out from the
west peak of Mt.  Olympus, One dome between the peaks, and one on the
west peak.  Some clue of the technology that ancient Thera thrived on
may be lying within the ruins of this place.

A road made of metal~
You come to an intersection.  The metal ends at the base of what
looks as if it were steps.  The concrete, or whatever material these
steps were made from has been worn by years of weathering and is now
chunks of gravel.  There is a bright yellow sign at the base of the
slope of gravel which says 'NO ENTRY --Sanaria Expedition Team--' The
road which leads east and west is an dirt trail invaded by the
natural vegetation of this mountainous region.

A road made of metal~
You are standing on a slope of gravel.  The form of steps in the
slope is still apparent and makes the accent easy.  You can see two
large doors looking up.  The doors look to be new leaving you to
wonder if they were made as an addition to this structure recently. 
You are obviously not the first one to climb this gravel slope, for
there is a trail worn by the steps of many feet, which you now
follow.

A road made of metal leading up a mountain.~
You come to Two large doors which stand between you and the
structure that lies between the two peaks of the mountain.  The doors
are new, and have been put here recently.  The structure to which
these doors have been built on to is made of a material you have
never seen.  It looks to be a material similar to quartz, but it has
been cracked and the luster is much less than that of crystal.

The central dome of the Space Port~
You are standing in a large building.  The ceiling is high above
you and the missing pieces let light in.  The light reflects off of
the walls of the hallway you are in.  The walls are made of the same
material that the outside of this building was made from and look
almost like cracked crystal.  There is yellow tape on the doors to
the east and west of you with the word 'CAUTION' printed on the tape.

is sphere like and broken in many places.  There are the shattered
remains of ceiling on the quartz like floor you are walking on.  It
makes a crunching sound as you step on the broken material similar to
that of crushing glass.

The sphere like ceiling, which is broken in many places, is also made
of the same quartz like material.

debris leaving a small path through the middle with mounds of the
broken material on each side.  The walls here show signs of age, but
are still in quite good shape considering the age of this structure,
which you cannot fathom after seeing that the concrete outside has
been completely destroyed by weathering.

same material that the road leading away from the mountain was made
of.  On the plaque is the picture of a strange bird.  This bird has
one large eye and its wings do not appear to bend while it is in the
air.  Around the picture is the same tape you saw on the doors with
the words CAUTION printed on it.  The hallway leads south west and
east from here.

You notice frames on the crystal like walls that are made of metal. 
The metal is tarnished, like that on the road which brought you to
this place.  There are no pictures in the frames, and you decide that
they probably rotted years ago.  You can go east or west from here.
