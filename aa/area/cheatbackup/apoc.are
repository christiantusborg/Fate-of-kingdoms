Outside the Gates of Dhurin Castle~
A narrow road leads up to the castle gates, two iron-bound portals
of wood that open directly into Dhurin Castle.  The bound-log walls
rise before you, and the faint sound of soldiers treading the
battlements can be heard.  To the south, the narrow road curves down
a slope and leads into the mountains.  East and west, a small trail
leads around the castle.

Inside the Gates of Dhurin Castle~
The sturdy, iron-bound gates of Dhurin Castle open into an entry
hall.  The walls and floor are constructed of thick wooden slats,
polished to a bright smoothness by thousands of passersby.  The entry
hall is lit by oil lanterns hanging on the walls.  To the north, the
hall continues into the castle itself.  To the west, a guarded
stairwell leads into the upper portion of the castle, and to the
east, a small guard station has been erected.

Approaching Dhurin Castle~
The narrow mountain road climbs the steady slope to the north
toward the solid walls of Dhurin Castle.  An imposing structure of
tightly bound logs, the sturdy walls of the castle protect the
inhabitants from raiding creatures.  The battlements along the top
are lined with sharpened wooden stakes, and Dhurin soldiers march
back and forth, watching for invaders.  The front gates lie directly
to the north.
