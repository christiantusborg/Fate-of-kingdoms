Desc You see standing before you a young looking male felar with a
muscular athletic build and slightly above average height.  He would
look like any other felar except for his silvery white fur and
flowing ocean blue eyes.  His long silvery white hair is tied back
from his face which draws more attention to his interesting eyes.  
~
Immtitle Immortal~
Back Grazzt was born into a poor family of felars, he had many brothers
and sisters, and with very little money they all had to pitch in. 
Grazzt had a bad talent when it came to his profession, a bard.  He
couldn't sing, nor could he play very well, but he didn't give up and
as time went he became better and better.  He went from bar to bar,
making very little, but entertaind the guests.  He quickly realised
there wasn't much to earn in the small city, so he set out towards
Sanaria.  Along the way he started thinking of new tunes and lyrics
to sing for the people of Sanaria, but for some reason he couldn't
come up with anything.  Instead he kept hearing a vague tune as he
walked through the forest, he didn't know what it was, or where it
came from.  But the tune he heard was like nothing he had heard
before, it was soothing and relaxing to listen to and made him feel
much better.  As he wandered through the forest he came to a clearing
where he sat down to rest, he had been walking for many hours and his
feet were getting sore.  He made camp there for the day and night,
and he started playing some of his old tunes infront of the campfire.
Every now and then he swore he could hear the wind playing a
unfamiliar tune for him, but he could not figure out what it was nor
how it was playd.  So eventually Grazzt fell asleep infront of the
fire on his ragged bedroll.  The next morning he headed towards
Sanaria again, slowly he could see the city appearing in the horizon
and he thought to himself "hopefully this is a town where people
appriciate a good song while enjoying a glass of beer and whatnot"
