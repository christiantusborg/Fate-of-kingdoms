Ok. Since we're now up and running again, and Kazmir wants changes
I thought I could write a list of things I want changed.
 
I noticed exp has been cut in half again, thats somewhat okay
but we also gotta struggle with this damn trophy. Why? 
 
We dont need both exp cuts and trophy list. Remove one of them I think.
 
I heard highest mortal level gonna change from 81 to 90. 
sounds easy but that means all classes will have to get more highlevel
skills/spells. And this will take time. Second, exp stops after 75
struggling through 6 levels of just rping and boting is enough.
This brings out a new point. Remove the 'no exp' after level 75. 
Let us level all the way!
 
Lemme know what ya guys think.

maximum.Once you hit 75 allow exp to be cut in half again.
Allowing only a 250 max gain.
But also adding in a remort system.Giving player's the 
option of remorting after gaining a certain level.
Keep trophy in the system.

That need's to be slowed down.I think's that a little drastic.

500 exp max per kill no matter what align sounds good.
I think we should add that. Cut exp in half after lvl 75 also
sounds neat. I just really want exp after 75, trying to level from 
boting and RPing is bloody tough. :)
 
Remort system, naaaah. I kinda think Kazmirs idea of spescs
sounds cool though. But all this aint no stress really. 
First we need to even out races and classes, and exp from mobs. :)

Ok. Since we're now up and running again, and Kazmir wants changes
I thought I could write a list of things I want changed.
 
I noticed exp has been cut in half again, thats somewhat okay
but we also gotta struggle with this damn trophy. Why? 
 
We dont need both exp cuts and trophy list. Remove one of them I think.
 
I heard highest mortal level gonna change from 81 to 90. 
sounds easy but that means all classes will have to get more highlevel
skills/spells. And this will take time. Second, exp stops after 75
struggling through 6 levels of just rping and boting is enough.
This brings out a new point. Remove the 'no exp' after level 75. 
Let us level all the way!

Allowing only a 250 max gain.

Text
You may be thinking about xp gain backwards...
 
Rather than thinking about how much xp you should get from
a kill; you should instead be thinking how long should it t
take to get a level.
 
For example, should you be able to get from level 10 to level 11
in an hr, a day, a week?  What about level 59-60.
 
Once you have an idea how long it should take to get from one level
to the next, you can take the most damaging spell for that level and
figure out how fast it takes to kill something.  Then you can set
the xp gain for that level appropraitely so you know you can't get a
level faster than the specified amount of time.
 
This is what I get I suppose for studying number theory for the last

Subject an idea on xp gain~
Text
You may be thinking about xp gain backwards...
 
Rather than thinking about how much xp you should get from
a kill; you should instead be thinking how long should it t
take to get a level.
 
For example, should you be able to get from level 10 to level 11
in an hr, a day, a week?  What about level 59-60.
 
Once you have an idea how long it should take to get from one level
to the next, you can take the most damaging spell for that level and
figure out how fast it takes to kill something.  Then you can set
the xp gain for that level appropraitely so you know you can't get a
level faster than the specified amount of time.
 
This is what I get I suppose for studying number theory for the last
4 years....

Ok. Since we're now up and running again, and Kazmir wants changes
I thought I could write a list of things I want changed.
 
I noticed exp has been cut in half again, thats somewhat okay
but we also gotta struggle with this damn trophy. Why? 
 
We dont need both exp cuts and trophy list. Remove one of them I think.
 
I heard highest mortal level gonna change from 81 to 90. 
sounds easy but that means all classes will have to get more highlevel
skills/spells. And this will take time. Second, exp stops after 75
struggling through 6 levels of just rping and boting is enough.
This brings out a new point. Remove the 'no exp' after level 75. 
Let us level all the way!
 
Lemme know what ya guys think.

maximum.Once you hit 75 allow exp to be cut in half again.
Allowing only a 250 max gain.
But also adding in a remort system.Giving player's the

Keep trophy in the system.

Subject an idea on xp gain~
Text
You may be thinking about xp gain backwards...
 
Rather than thinking about how much xp you should get from
a kill; you should instead be thinking how long should it t
take to get a level.
 
For example, should you be able to get from level 10 to level 11
in an hr, a day, a week?  What about level 59-60.
 
Once you have an idea how long it should take to get from one level
to the next, you can take the most damaging spell for that level and
figure out how fast it takes to kill something.  Then you can set
the xp gain for that level appropraitely so you know you can't get a
level faster than the specified amount of time.
 
This is what I get I suppose for studying number theory for the last
4 years....

Just a few quick notes...
 
 
1.  Salindor's here?  How fuckin' cool is *that*?
 
2.  It's possible that we're all overthinking this entire
thing.  Trophy, exp limits, the like -- do those truly need
to exist?  What purpose do they serve, save making a player's
life harder?  I mean, shit.  Nobody's trying to make Art
(with a capital "A") here.  We're all here to waste time and
play a game.  If someone wants to put the time in and hit 81
in a day...well...yeah.  Why penalize the entire community
just because someone's life is a void (just kiddin', you know
I love you, Jay :P)?  Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best.
 
 
3.  Could we get an official announcement, or a list, of who
exactly is running the asylum now?
 
 
4.  Oh...and, welcome back everyone.  ;-)

Ok. Since we're now up and running again, and Kazmir wants changes
I thought I could write a list of things I want changed.
 
I noticed exp has been cut in half again, thats somewhat okay
but we also gotta struggle with this damn trophy. Why? 
 
We dont need both exp cuts and trophy list. Remove one of them I think.
 
I heard highest mortal level gonna change from 81 to 90. 
sounds easy but that means all classes will have to get more highlevel
skills/spells. And this will take time. Second, exp stops after 75
struggling through 6 levels of just rping and boting is enough.
This brings out a new point. Remove the 'no exp' after level 75. 
Let us level all the way!
 
Lemme know what ya guys think.

maximum.Once you hit 75 allow exp to be cut in half again.
Allowing only a 250 max gain.
But also adding in a remort system.Giving player's the

Keep trophy in the system.
 
But one other thing.Food/water is bad now.I can sit idle

That need's to be slowed down.I think's that a little drastic.

I think we should add that. Cut exp in half after lvl 75 also
sounds neat. I just really want exp after 75, trying to level from 
boting and RPing is bloody tough. :)
 
Remort system, naaaah. I kinda think Kazmirs idea of spescs

Here is my personal opinion (for better or for worse):
    a) newbie levels should be conquarable in a day
    b) low levels should be conquarable in a month
    c) mid levels should be conquarable in 6 months
    d) endgame levels should be conquarable in a year
 
There should be (not there will be) a new skill or improvement
to an old skill every other level.
 
trophy, xp limits, and the like should be reserved to be
released until after 25% of the mud is capped
 
I have personally become a fan of either level cap areas, or
self-adjusting areas (i.e mobs levels are raised for level 81)
for quest areas.

Another suggestion, I would think that it would greatly make sense to
add more stealable items, especially for low level thief. There isn't
much to steal, or any chance to steal untill you get blackjack or
around that level. I love being a thief, but I don't feel like one
since the whole point of being a thief, STEALING,
requires you to be high level.

Subject an idea on xp gain~
Text
You may be thinking about xp gain backwards...
 
Rather than thinking about how much xp you should get from
a kill; you should instead be thinking how long should it t
take to get a level.
 
For example, should you be able to get from level 10 to level 11
in an hr, a day, a week?  What about level 59-60.
 
Once you have an idea how long it should take to get from one level
to the next, you can take the most damaging spell for that level and
figure out how fast it takes to kill something.  Then you can set
the xp gain for that level appropraitely so you know you can't get a
level faster than the specified amount of time.
 
This is what I get I suppose for studying number theory for the last
4 years....

1.  Salindor's here?  How fuckin' cool is *that*?
 
2.  It's possible that we're all overthinking this entire
thing.  Trophy, exp limits, the like -- do those truly need

life harder?  I mean, shit.  Nobody's trying to make Art
(with a capital "A") here.  We're all here to waste time and
play a game.  If someone wants to put the time in and hit 81
in a day...well...yeah.  Why penalize the entire community
just because someone's life is a void (just kiddin', you know

Here is my personal opinion (for better or for worse):
    a) newbie levels should be conquarable in a day
    b) low levels should be conquarable in a month
    c) mid levels should be conquarable in 6 months
    d) endgame levels should be conquarable in a year
 
There should be (not there will be) a new skill or improvement
to an old skill every other level.
 
trophy, xp limits, and the like should be reserved to be
released until after 25% of the mud is capped
 
I have personally become a fan of either level cap areas, or

for quest areas.

Ok. Since we're now up and running again, and Kazmir wants changes
I thought I could write a list of things I want changed.
 
I noticed exp has been cut in half again, thats somewhat okay
but we also gotta struggle with this damn trophy. Why? 
 
We dont need both exp cuts and trophy list. Remove one of them I think.
 
I heard highest mortal level gonna change from 81 to 90. 
sounds easy but that means all classes will have to get more highlevel
skills/spells. And this will take time. Second, exp stops after 75
struggling through 6 levels of just rping and boting is enough.
This brings out a new point. Remove the 'no exp' after level 75. 
Let us level all the way!

That need's to be slowed down.I think's that a little drastic.

500 exp max per kill no matter what align sounds good.
I think we should add that. Cut exp in half after lvl 75 also
sounds neat. I just really want exp after 75, trying to level from 
boting and RPing is bloody tough. :)
 
Remort system, naaaah. I kinda think Kazmirs idea of spescs
sounds cool though. But all this aint no stress really. 
First we need to even out races and classes, and exp from mobs. :)

500 exp max per kill no matter what align sounds good.
I think we should add that. Cut exp in half after lvl 75 also
sounds neat. I just really want exp after 75, trying to level from 
boting and RPing is bloody tough. :)
 
Remort system, naaaah. I kinda think Kazmirs idea of spescs

Text
You may be thinking about xp gain backwards...
 
Rather than thinking about how much xp you should get from
a kill; you should instead be thinking how long should it t
take to get a level.
 
For example, should you be able to get from level 10 to level 11
in an hr, a day, a week?  What about level 59-60.
 
Once you have an idea how long it should take to get from one level
to the next, you can take the most damaging spell for that level and
figure out how fast it takes to kill something.  Then you can set
the xp gain for that level appropraitely so you know you can't get a
level faster than the specified amount of time.
 
This is what I get I suppose for studying number theory for the last
4 years....

    a) newbie levels should be conquarable in a day
    b) low levels should be conquarable in a month
    c) mid levels should be conquarable in 6 months
    d) endgame levels should be conquarable in a year
 
There should be (not there will be) a new skill or improvement

Ok. Since we're now up and running again, and Kazmir wants changes
I thought I could write a list of things I want changed.
 
I noticed exp has been cut in half again, thats somewhat okay
but we also gotta struggle with this damn trophy. Why? 
 
We dont need both exp cuts and trophy list. Remove one of them I think.
 
I heard highest mortal level gonna change from 81 to 90. 
sounds easy but that means all classes will have to get more highlevel
skills/spells. And this will take time. Second, exp stops after 75
struggling through 6 levels of just rping and boting is enough.
This brings out a new point. Remove the 'no exp' after level 75. 
Let us level all the way!

    d) endgame levels should be conquarable in a year
 
There should be (not there will be) a new skill or improvement
to an old skill every other level.
 
trophy, xp limits, and the like should be reserved to be
released until after 25% of the mud is capped
 
I have personally become a fan of either level cap areas, or
self-adjusting areas (i.e mobs levels are raised for level 81)
for quest areas.

I think the main problem with fate, possibly for as long as
I can remember, has been the playerbase. 
 
We have a great game here, and only a handful of people who
play it. Other muds are sporting huge numbers, and we have
around 20, give or take- most of which don't play regularly, 
resulting in 2-4 people on at a time. How're we to roleplay
constructing great kingdoms and fighting huge battles in an
environment that has barely anyone in it?
 
I think that the problem is that Fate of Kingdoms' only adver-
tisement for years now has been word-of-mouth and a crummy
mudconnector account. When's the last time you were on 
mudconnector? Probably not recently.
 
I'll admit some of the problem is that Fate just started back up,
and we don't have all of our old players back- but what if we could
have more than just the old, not-so-impressive playerbase? What
if we could have a couple times that?
 
I think that we need some major, thought-out advertisement. I, for
one would volunteer to create and run an official Fate of Kingdoms
myspace. Think about it- there are millions of nerds on myspace.
We just want 20 or 30 of them. 
 
The only help I'd need would be the layout and info. It would be
nice to have someone (preferably an imm with some access,) help
me run it, and fill in all the information on classes, races, etc. as
well as perhaps the background we had on the old site and maybe
that fairy picture for the display.
 
And can anyone make an HTML banner for Fate of Kingdoms that
would link them to out hypothetical myspace? That would work out
great.
 
I need an imm to get ahold of me on this deal.
 
Give me feedback and your opinions on the matter.

I got the ok's from Kaz, but I wanted to let everyone know.
There might be 2 players logging on from this socket and those are;
I'll be using xao, grazzt, zanian, kirigi, seyshana or cruros.
Other player will be Divoga, he might create another alt or 2.
I'll post an update if he does.

I was thinking about your two ideas your presented about
kingdoms and them losing powers.  I have thought of a new
one based on those two.
 
My problem with both them has been an old one, how do you
handle the various play times.  Also on the flip side, how
do you handle cowardous kingdoms and so I thought of maybe
a solution to it.
 
There are two kinds of attacks, sneak attacks, and planned
attacks.
 
Sneak attacks are unannouced but can only occur in certain
conditions:
   1) the two kingdoms have an alliance and one kingdom is going
      to break the alliance and declare war
   2) half of the other kingdom's members are logged in
   3) half the other kingdom's members haven't logged in for
      72 hrs
 
During a sneak attack, all guards in the city are given double
hp, mp, etc etc to simulate that sneak attacks can not normally
use the full armies otherwise they would be discovered.
 
Planned attacks must be annouced 24 hrs in advance and provide
3 different times for the opposite side to choose from.  This
simulates that when a large battle is going to happen, rarely
does the opposite side not know where the battle is going to
occur.  The choice in times is to help ensure both sides have
the maximum number of people to attack/defend.  
 
Then your idea with having a sphere in the castle can be done
where the sphere contains the kingdom's powers.  However, capturing
it wouldn't be a short time period.
 
During either of the attacks, sneak or full, the pk range should be
removed for all kingdom members.  We could also institute a mercanary
system as well maybe, where a kingdom can pay a player not affliated
with the two warring kingdoms to join a battle on their side.  In this
case they get a special rank of mercanary for 24hrs, and they are
considered part of the kingdom they accepted money from.
 
Also castles the guards should always be extra strong.

What is the public opinion on shaman's getting a 
snoop type spell has their "high level" skill/spell
ability.
But of course it wouldn't be "snoop" it would of
course have a diff name.Maybe something like
  "Invision"
 
pretty similiar to vision,heh.

Actually, the term "Vision" would be more in flavor with
shamen.  Maybe they could get that spell, while the mage's
"vision" could be re-named something like "Scry" -- in keeping
with the archetypical flavor of the wizard class.

Subject skill timers~
Text
This would be an approach for offering more powerful skills
or weakening powerful skills without really weaking it.
 
The idea is fundamentally different from putting lag on a skill
as log affects the characters ability todo anything else after
that for a brief time.  While some skills I believe this is good,
others end up being weakened in other mannors (like doing less 
damage, etc etc) because we have to basically assume the caster
is going to spam the spell.
 
So lets say I modified fireball with a cooldown for every 3 ticks.
Then I could possibly triple its damage because I know that the 
spell couldn't be cast but once every 3 combat rounds.
 
Then we could even have skills which shorten the timer (remember
I believe there shoudl be a skill gained every other level).

Subject Re Salindor - ideas~
Text
I have to disagree with the last rule in being able to state
whether or not the rule is flawed or not. Specially in case
recently brought to light. When it's Severely undercutting
a class for an already well established affect. I think the
racial abilities need to be a little more then just affects
of fly,infravision,darkvision,etc. sure those can be minor
aspects. But it's a definable trait ability which sets the
races apart. Even DnD has definable traits which set them
apart or make up for lacking. Such as humans gaining extra
pracs/trains due to their lack of noticable "gains".
 
Not to mention the "power" scale really needs to be really
re-worked in the means of what's going to be a greater race.
You have lesser and greater races which determine the value
of the ability or even the ammount. Example:
 
Race: Human
Scale: Mid-class
Abilities:
+1 pt No vulnerabilties
-1 pt No Resistances
+2 pt additional practice sessions per level
+1 pt Additional training point Recieved at every 10? levels
-3 pt no (additional racial) affects or abilities 
 
 
 
I just think some sort of system needs to be laid out almost
like Big Eyes. Small Mouth and I'm sure even DnD has a system
for determining who gets what. Not to mention I know you 
yourself Sal stated that you disliked the idea of people 
playing full troll, ogre, and various other full breed type
races of the obtuse sort due to the fact often they are played
very wrongly on this mud. Which I would agree most don't know
the RP of a troll or ogre and often go for the power aspect.
But I also think the class system needs to be reworked a little
based more on what it is the race. Right now there is claims it
is based on alignment but that is flawed. Not to mention the
fact I'm sure there is things other then humans worshiping other
forest dieties for ranger like abilities that wish to purge the
world of the human and others infestation for their god. If the
rangers are like DnD. I think it needs to be reworked to what
races are more prone to what profession. Shaman is sort of a
tribal race variation of druids of Druids. So I can understand
more of the "uncivilized" races offered that potential instead
of druids sometimes even clerics. Both are Educated standings in
most RP settings.
 
Then there is the noted exceptions for things I know the aligns
were imposed due to the overflow of drows in the past. I won't
argue the fact some of them need to be imposed due to their
I guess lack of a better term lusty natures whichever way they
may sway. But I think a number of races need to be more borderline
if not in the middle being able to slide up and down the scale.
Not all normal elves are gonna be good some might not even like
being evil. Not to mention the imposed faction is kinda killer
for some because they wanna be the oposing faction.
 
 
Moving on past the align issue I'm curious to know if we are going
to stick with the already introduced races or tweaking them? Since
as previously stated there are some that seem out of place for the
avg player's spectrum of play. Will we get some voice in the matter
or is it gonna be we like this so you are screwed and stuck with
this like Kazmir often used to do?
 
 
Taking a step forward but a few steps back to the racial abilities
it's not that some aren't over powered and other useless etc. that
much i would agree on. But I think we need something that keeps 
each race unique like I think was the intent of kazmir's adding of 
the abilities. Sure I'll try to come up with some ideas myself but
I think first the idea of what races will be changing,staying put
augmenting to another and so on should be decided first. And my
question is why are you starting with arials *pout* okay moving on
again.
 
I think instead of just jumping in with what skills should be added
or taken out I think first it needs to be decided on what is flawed
and what actually needs to change in the game first. You got issues
and bugs from god knows how long ago that don't even deal with races
and the like. Then comes the factor Why start thinking up something
that might not even stay in?
 
For me it's a kinda kick in the nuts cuz I'm starting to enjoy the
Arials but I'm not even getting to see if the ability is overpowered
due to the past hate for the race. Swoop has always been an avian
style skill which is nice if properly done. It just fits them so in
a way the hatred for them continues now.  Same with some of the the
races that got obtuse limited abilities but can be devestating when
combo'd with your imaginitive use of skills. Point remains I think
first needs to be established what races are going to remain and 
changes established first before throwing out the offer for ideas
on the matter. Not to mention those of the ranks as Put in a previous
note should have some voice in the matter even if not the deciding 
factor they should at least be offered a voice in the matter pertaining
to the character they are currently working on. Because frankly the
idea posed for the replacements for Arial are just a little better 
then the affect of fly now. Flying over boundaries that most can just
be passed around due to all the holes. Followed up by a further redux
to your movement cost, I'm not a super genius but even I would say
that's a total screw considering the fact swoop isn't even able to
be over powered as it is due to it's nature to fail and so far from
my experience that's 1 our of 3 attempts that fail if it even hits.
So you are taking a skill that screws us to begin with and screwing 
us further stupid,dumb,illogical there is a number of names that can
be placed on the turn of events the fact still remains if there was
more then myself you'd piss alot of players off if you didn't at 
least come up with something a little more original then an augmented
fly affect. I reference the fact even if kazmir's ideas were a bit
odd and grandiose he at least went for uniqueness. We kinda need to
keep races unique that's my vote. I'll gladly help when I can with ideas
if that's what is needed from us. But you can't just keep the supposed
"brainstorming" sessions amongst "those who matter" if you want us to
have a voice and offer up our own ideas. Hell I'd love to sit in and
throw around the ideas to help make the place a little better if it
means a better mud for all. But most times long ago no matter what was
said even in the logic was in your favor in your argument sometimes
got thrown out due to it not being the opinion of those favored. So
I guess what I'm trying to say is if the opening for players to take
part in the brainstorming is open I'll take it. Just if I'm not gonna
get the oppurtunity to take part in it at least post the ideas for 
additional ammendments or ideas fromt he player aspect. I can understand
throwing them out if way over powered but I think some considerations
need to be made for some racial abilities.
 
 
Well that's my rant and I'm sticking to it.

The 1 out of 3 attempts fails meaning knocks you out due to extrem

Wasn't it you who told me yourself that from the scientist perspective
if the model is flawed you are supposed to tear it apart? :) I think
I made valid points though the inference and maybe blatant statement
of foolishness may be harsh I think my arguments do support it pretty
well. You are free to make a counter argument as always with our little
joy filled debates. But no my intent as Karnun viewed it was not dis-
respect so much as speaking up where everyone else is afraid it seems
and I'd rather see the points coming out in counter even if I gotta
play the bad guy. I will gladly listen to your counter points like we
always do but at least take into consideration the points I made 
myself due to the fact it was you who said if the model is flawed then
by all means tear it apart. I may not be a scientist but I still have
some logic. :) As always looking forward to your return arguments let
the others including Baeleron I mean no ill will nor bear any anger
in my position on the debate.

First off, I don't care if you disagree with my last rule.
 
It came from someone with a phd in law, phsycology and software
engineering.
 
During the brainstorm phase, its entire point is to generate
other ideas.  So a person posts the idea no matter how stupid it
is, with the idea nobody is going to tell them it is so because
that might spawn another idea which is really good.
 
Then during the next phase, after brainstorming each idea is evaluated
one at a time.  That is the time people say, hey I don't agree with
your idea.  Another possibilty is instead of bashing the other idea
you can post an alternative.  Obviously if the person is posting an
idea about something, they think it can be done better.
 
There is a method to my madness.

Subject note level 15 restrict~
Text
I think the reason notes are restricted to level 15 is 
for antiquated reasons.  But that section predates me.
 
If I have to make a bet, it would prolly be for immature children
who get balefired from creating 1000 posts in retailation.
We can simply balefire each character spamming posts, and that
way there is at most a day between spams (well until we ban
in the least).

I see how, back in the day, it would be good to restrict it
till 15...as that would have required a little bit of playing
time, but enough to discourage anyone who just wants to dick
around with the note board.  However, now it takes a while
to hit 15 from the get-go.  I'd reccommend setting the level
restriction at level 5.

I have to disagree with the last rule in being able to state
whether or not the rule is flawed or not. Specially in case
recently brought to light. When it's Severely undercutting
a class for an already well established affect. I think the
racial abilities need to be a little more then just affects
of fly,infravision,darkvision,etc. sure those can be minor
aspects. But it's a definable trait ability which sets the
races apart. Even DnD has definable traits which set them
apart or make up for lacking. Such as humans gaining extra
pracs/trains due to their lack of noticable "gains".
 
Not to mention the "power" scale really needs to be really
re-worked in the means of what's going to be a greater race.
You have lesser and greater races which determine the value
of the ability or even the ammount. Example:
 
Race: Human
Scale: Mid-class
Abilities:
+1 pt No vulnerabilties
-1 pt No Resistances
+2 pt additional practice sessions per level
+1 pt Additional training point Recieved at every 10? levels
-3 pt no (additional racial) affects or abilities 
 
 
 
I just think some sort of system needs to be laid out almost
like Big Eyes. Small Mouth and I'm sure even DnD has a system
for determining who gets what. Not to mention I know you 
yourself Sal stated that you disliked the idea of people 
playing full troll, ogre, and various other full breed type
races of the obtuse sort due to the fact often they are played
very wrongly on this mud. Which I would agree most don't know
the RP of a troll or ogre and often go for the power aspect.
But I also think the class system needs to be reworked a little
based more on what it is the race. Right now there is claims it
is based on alignment but that is flawed. Not to mention the
fact I'm sure there is things other then humans worshiping other
forest dieties for ranger like abilities that wish to purge the
world of the human and others infestation for their god. If the
rangers are like DnD. I think it needs to be reworked to what
races are more prone to what profession. Shaman is sort of a
tribal race variation of druids of Druids. So I can understand
more of the "uncivilized" races offered that potential instead
of druids sometimes even clerics. Both are Educated standings in
most RP settings.
 
Then there is the noted exceptions for things I know the aligns
were imposed due to the overflow of drows in the past. I won't
argue the fact some of them need to be imposed due to their
I guess lack of a better term lusty natures whichever way they
may sway. But I think a number of races need to be more borderline
if not in the middle being able to slide up and down the scale.
Not all normal elves are gonna be good some might not even like
being evil. Not to mention the imposed faction is kinda killer
for some because they wanna be the oposing faction.
 
 
Moving on past the align issue I'm curious to know if we are going
to stick with the already introduced races or tweaking them? Since
as previously stated there are some that seem out of place for the
avg player's spectrum of play. Will we get some voice in the matter
or is it gonna be we like this so you are screwed and stuck with
this like Kazmir often used to do?
 
 
Taking a step forward but a few steps back to the racial abilities
it's not that some aren't over powered and other useless etc. that
much i would agree on. But I think we need something that keeps 
each race unique like I think was the intent of kazmir's adding of 
the abilities. Sure I'll try to come up with some ideas myself but
I think first the idea of what races will be changing,staying put
augmenting to another and so on should be decided first. And my
question is why are you starting with arials *pout* okay moving on
again.
 
I think instead of just jumping in with what skills should be added
or taken out I think first it needs to be decided on what is flawed
and what actually needs to change in the game first. You got issues
and bugs from god knows how long ago that don't even deal with races
and the like. Then comes the factor Why start thinking up something
that might not even stay in?
 
For me it's a kinda kick in the nuts cuz I'm starting to enjoy the
Arials but I'm not even getting to see if the ability is overpowered
due to the past hate for the race. Swoop has always been an avian
style skill which is nice if properly done. It just fits them so in
a way the hatred for them continues now.  Same with some of the the
races that got obtuse limited abilities but can be devestating when
combo'd with your imaginitive use of skills. Point remains I think
first needs to be established what races are going to remain and 
changes established first before throwing out the offer for ideas
on the matter. Not to mention those of the ranks as Put in a previous
note should have some voice in the matter even if not the deciding 
factor they should at least be offered a voice in the matter pertaining
to the character they are currently working on. Because frankly the
idea posed for the replacements for Arial are just a little better 
then the affect of fly now. Flying over boundaries that most can just
be passed around due to all the holes. Followed up by a further redux
to your movement cost, I'm not a super genius but even I would say
that's a total screw considering the fact swoop isn't even able to
be over powered as it is due to it's nature to fail and so far from
my experience that's 1 our of 3 attempts that fail if it even hits.
So you are taking a skill that screws us to begin with and screwing 
us further stupid,dumb,illogical there is a number of names that can
be placed on the turn of events the fact still remains if there was
more then myself you'd piss alot of players off if you didn't at 
least come up with something a little more original then an augmented
fly affect. I reference the fact even if kazmir's ideas were a bit
odd and grandiose he at least went for uniqueness. We kinda need to
keep races unique that's my vote. I'll gladly help when I can with ideas
if that's what is needed from us. But you can't just keep the supposed
"brainstorming" sessions amongst "those who matter" if you want us to
have a voice and offer up our own ideas. Hell I'd love to sit in and
throw around the ideas to help make the place a little better if it
means a better mud for all. But most times long ago no matter what was
said even in the logic was in your favor in your argument sometimes
got thrown out due to it not being the opinion of those favored. So
I guess what I'm trying to say is if the opening for players to take
part in the brainstorming is open I'll take it. Just if I'm not gonna
get the oppurtunity to take part in it at least post the ideas for 
additional ammendments or ideas fromt he player aspect. I can understand
throwing them out if way over powered but I think some considerations
need to be made for some racial abilities.
 
 
Well that's my rant and I'm sticking to it.

The 1 out of 3 attempts fails meaning knocks you out due to extrem
failure which last quite a few ticks. Maybe not as long as being
mortally wounded but still a bit too long.So it makes the fear of
using the skill that much greater.

I see how, back in the day, it would be good to restrict it
till 15...as that would have required a little bit of playing
time, but enough to discourage anyone who just wants to dick
around with the note board.  However, now it takes a while
to hit 15 from the get-go.  I'd reccommend setting the level
restriction at level 5.

I have to disagree with the last rule in being able to state
whether or not the rule is flawed or not. Specially in case
recently brought to light. When it's Severely undercutting
a class for an already well established affect. I think the
racial abilities need to be a little more then just affects
of fly,infravision,darkvision,etc. sure those can be minor
aspects. But it's a definable trait ability which sets the
races apart. Even DnD has definable traits which set them
apart or make up for lacking. Such as humans gaining extra
pracs/trains due to their lack of noticable "gains".
 
Not to mention the "power" scale really needs to be really
re-worked in the means of what's going to be a greater race.
You have lesser and greater races which determine the value
of the ability or even the ammount. Example:
 
Race: Human
Scale: Mid-class
Abilities:
+1 pt No vulnerabilties
-1 pt No Resistances
+2 pt additional practice sessions per level
+1 pt Additional training point Recieved at every 10? levels
-3 pt no (additional racial) affects or abilities 
 
 
 
I just think some sort of system needs to be laid out almost
like Big Eyes. Small Mouth and I'm sure even DnD has a system
for determining who gets what. Not to mention I know you 
yourself Sal stated that you disliked the idea of people 
playing full troll, ogre, and various other full breed type
races of the obtuse sort due to the fact often they are played
very wrongly on this mud. Which I would agree most don't know
the RP of a troll or ogre and often go for the power aspect.
But I also think the class system needs to be reworked a little
based more on what it is the race. Right now there is claims it
is based on alignment but that is flawed. Not to mention the
fact I'm sure there is things other then humans worshiping other
forest dieties for ranger like abilities that wish to purge the
world of the human and others infestation for their god. If the
rangers are like DnD. I think it needs to be reworked to what
races are more prone to what profession. Shaman is sort of a
tribal race variation of druids of Druids. So I can understand
more of the "uncivilized" races offered that potential instead
of druids sometimes even clerics. Both are Educated standings in
most RP settings.
 
Then there is the noted exceptions for things I know the aligns
were imposed due to the overflow of drows in the past. I won't
argue the fact some of them need to be imposed due to their
I guess lack of a better term lusty natures whichever way they
may sway. But I think a number of races need to be more borderline
if not in the middle being able to slide up and down the scale.
Not all normal elves are gonna be good some might not even like
being evil. Not to mention the imposed faction is kinda killer
for some because they wanna be the oposing faction.
 
 
Moving on past the align issue I'm curious to know if we are going
to stick with the already introduced races or tweaking them? Since
as previously stated there are some that seem out of place for the
avg player's spectrum of play. Will we get some voice in the matter
or is it gonna be we like this so you are screwed and stuck with
this like Kazmir often used to do?
 
 
Taking a step forward but a few steps back to the racial abilities
it's not that some aren't over powered and other useless etc. that
much i would agree on. But I think we need something that keeps 
each race unique like I think was the intent of kazmir's adding of 
the abilities. Sure I'll try to come up with some ideas myself but
I think first the idea of what races will be changing,staying put
augmenting to another and so on should be decided first. And my
question is why are you starting with arials *pout* okay moving on
again.
 
I think instead of just jumping in with what skills should be added
or taken out I think first it needs to be decided on what is flawed
and what actually needs to change in the game first. You got issues
and bugs from god knows how long ago that don't even deal with races
and the like. Then comes the factor Why start thinking up something
that might not even stay in?
 
For me it's a kinda kick in the nuts cuz I'm starting to enjoy the
Arials but I'm not even getting to see if the ability is overpowered
due to the past hate for the race. Swoop has always been an avian
style skill which is nice if properly done. It just fits them so in
a way the hatred for them continues now.  Same with some of the the
races that got obtuse limited abilities but can be devestating when
combo'd with your imaginitive use of skills. Point remains I think
first needs to be established what races are going to remain and 
changes established first before throwing out the offer for ideas
on the matter. Not to mention those of the ranks as Put in a previous
note should have some voice in the matter even if not the deciding 
factor they should at least be offered a voice in the matter pertaining
to the character they are currently working on. Because frankly the
idea posed for the replacements for Arial are just a little better 
then the affect of fly now. Flying over boundaries that most can just
be passed around due to all the holes. Followed up by a further redux
to your movement cost, I'm not a super genius but even I would say
that's a total screw considering the fact swoop isn't even able to
be over powered as it is due to it's nature to fail and so far from
my experience that's 1 our of 3 attempts that fail if it even hits.
So you are taking a skill that screws us to begin with and screwing 
us further stupid,dumb,illogical there is a number of names that can
be placed on the turn of events the fact still remains if there was
more then myself you'd piss alot of players off if you didn't at 
least come up with something a little more original then an augmented
fly affect. I reference the fact even if kazmir's ideas were a bit
odd and grandiose he at least went for uniqueness. We kinda need to
keep races unique that's my vote. I'll gladly help when I can with ideas
if that's what is needed from us. But you can't just keep the supposed
"brainstorming" sessions amongst "those who matter" if you want us to
have a voice and offer up our own ideas. Hell I'd love to sit in and
throw around the ideas to help make the place a little better if it
means a better mud for all. But most times long ago no matter what was
said even in the logic was in your favor in your argument sometimes
got thrown out due to it not being the opinion of those favored. So
I guess what I'm trying to say is if the opening for players to take
part in the brainstorming is open I'll take it. Just if I'm not gonna
get the oppurtunity to take part in it at least post the ideas for 
additional ammendments or ideas fromt he player aspect. I can understand
throwing them out if way over powered but I think some considerations
need to be made for some racial abilities.
 
 
Well that's my rant and I'm sticking to it.

First off, I don't care if you disagree with my last rule.
 
It came from someone with a phd in law, phsycology and software
engineering.
 
During the brainstorm phase, its entire point is to generate
other ideas.  So a person posts the idea no matter how stupid it
is, with the idea nobody is going to tell them it is so because
that might spawn another idea which is really good.
 
Then during the next phase, after brainstorming each idea is evaluated
one at a time.  That is the time people say, hey I don't agree with
your idea.  Another possibilty is instead of bashing the other idea
you can post an alternative.  Obviously if the person is posting an
idea about something, they think it can be done better.
 
There is a method to my madness.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show

spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated

Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

Subject Skills~

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross

I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire
away like it or hate it.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire
away like it or hate it.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of
particularly memorable kills...

Subject preservation~
Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Text
Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Subject preservation~
Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Text
Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again

However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set
of mobs.  You can not do, 'where 2.amber'  
 
I think this should be changed.
 
It used to be able to do it but I guess someone messed with the code.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set
of mobs.  You can not do, 'where 2.amber'  
 
I think this should be changed.
 
It used to be able to do it but I guess someone messed with the code.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

in the mountain's on the world map wouldn't be such

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of
particularly memorable kills...

Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross

I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire
away like it or hate it.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire
away like it or hate it.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of
particularly memorable kills...

Subject preservation~
Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Text
Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Subject preservation~
Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Text
Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again

However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set
of mobs.  You can not do, 'where 2.amber'  
 
I think this should be changed.
 
It used to be able to do it but I guess someone messed with the code.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set
of mobs.  You can not do, 'where 2.amber'  
 
I think this should be changed.
 
It used to be able to do it but I guess someone messed with the code.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.
 
 
 
Thought this would be a better name for Scry.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

in the mountain's on the world map wouldn't be such

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of
particularly memorable kills...

Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud
but on this point I think its a stereotype and we have enough of that
in real life, lets keep it out of our make believe world.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross

I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a
travesty.  Plenty of men are smarter than plenty of women and the
opposite is ofcourse true as well.  Plenty of women are stronger
than plenty of men.  I think kith is using his brain to better the mud

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill

Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do

It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into

Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire
away like it or hate it.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into
play on this idea from being a chef] BLast Away love it
or hate it! Hurt me!
 
Just make sure it's kinky! just kiddin. But seriously fire
away like it or hate it.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of
particularly memorable kills...

Subject preservation~
Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Text
Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Don't exactly see the need for food to spoil, however I do
see uses for something like a "Preserve" spell.  Namely, give
it to clerics and necromancers (masters of life and death) so
they can cast it on body parts of fallen people.  
 
It'd make a perfect way to preserve heads as trophies of

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Subject preservation~
Text
I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Text
Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again

However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make

more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!
We need you!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!
We need you!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I ran across a rp message board earlier today and saw a 
shaman d&d based spell called "Spirit Walk"
It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another
place.Breaking it down I can see this easily as a high
level shaman spell.
 
Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on
target mobile/player.

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinkin perhaps allowing 4 man,5 man groups
on fate.For over a decade the code has been the same up
to 3 people group and anymore then that 0 exp.
4. 5. group would encourage more player interacting
and gtell fun making the leveling go faster and time.
It would also be a good change to see.For exp:
4 man group=1/3 exp cut from max gain.5=2/3 cut
etc
 
 
 
Just an idea.

It allow's the shaman to leave his body and goto another

Allowing the shaman to leave his body and snoop on

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

Seperating males and females into two different groups would be a

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food
that will spoil or go rancid and essentially poison you
make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your
inventory. At least on things that might go bad. Which 
might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells
such as spoil. A discrete way that isn't shown in the
title of the item to poison and hurt people. Casting it
on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

4. 5. group would encourage more player interacting
and gtell fun making the leveling go faster and time.
It would also be a good change to see.For exp:

Another cool thought would be to add a high level skill
for ranger's called "Entrapment"  or even "Snare".
Allowing the ranger to set trap's around and whoever walk's into
the room and tries to escape cannot for a duration of time.
Maybe a tic sound's realistic.
To slow enemies down off a ranger's trail or also
to even trap a player/mobile for a short duration
to pop off some arrow's at target while trapped.
Considering there is a lag on arrow,it shouldnt
be overpowered or anything like that,especially if it
is made to 1 tic.
 
Usefull defensive and offensive skill.
I see alot of potential with that skill.
Would encourage more people to play ranger class.

Well we all know the fundamental difference between men and women?
If not go back to health class but my idea uses an aspect of that
relating to evolution.
 
Males by whatever element that spawned evolution were designated
the protector and thusly evolved more physically to perform said
task effectively. A gap women have tried to close unsuccessfully.
Now Women did not get cheated they evolved more so in the mental
area in what we attribute to early maturity.
 
So here is my idea in that we make slightly augmented versions
of each race whatever the final selection may be. Maybe it is
a small gap of only 1 or even 3 stat points  but enough to be
significant difference between the 2 genders. Physical aspects
for males and respectively mental for females. But I think it
would add a little more spice to the game if there was some 
aspect which further made the character unique from it's counter
-part gender wise.

Personally I think all classes shoudl be able to cross 
mountians.  Then I think rangers and druids should get
a bonus.
 
I think that rangers and druids shuld also be able to 
move in the wilderness as fast as fly.  However I think
fly should give an extra square of search space.  Finally
I think terrian type should give rangers and druids a bonus
to hiding within that terrian.
 
I also like the idea of making it so that skills improve
with level, and make it so players can't cap all skills (they
have to choose).
 
It might be interesting to create an 'illusionary terrian' spell
bards could get that would look identical to where the bard is
at but, really it would take you to some random spot on the world
map.  Teleporting to the bard, would cause you to go to the illusion
instead, and as soon as you walk off the terrian you would be someone
where else.

I really like the "Spirit Walk" idea.
 
Only, I think that instead of snooping, it should allow someone
to separate their spirit from their body, and have it roam freely
around Thera. It should be able to get through doors (locked
ones, even?) and be completely invisible.
There could even be an etheral glow that this spirit gives off
that allows it to see in the dark. This skill would be ideal in
war, and different kinds of espionage. There are ways that
it could be dummed down to make it less powerful, by say
only allowing a few commands to be executed whilst in
Spirit Form, like not allowing them to follow characters
or use any sort of social command.
This would probably be a higher level skill. There are other
possibilites with something like this- maybe there would be
spells that the shaman/whoever got later on to build onto this
spell. Maybe a few levels after Spirit Walk the Shaman can
get the ability to transport an item at a time from their body.
I think that while a character is using the Spirit Walk ability
their body should be stationary, and if it is attacked they would
be drawn right back into their former conciousness. It could even
be so that, when in Spirit Walk the Shaman is unable to become
invisible, making it so they're more vulnerable.
I also had an idea for a spell:
Magnet Thrust
 
syntax: cast 'magnetic thrust' <target><direction>
 
example: c 'magnetic thrust' henn west
 
This spell would allow the caster to create a magnetic force
that propels their opponent into a direction of their choosing. This
would be useful in throwing opponents into aggro mobs, or into
other opponents. It could also be a useful fleeing technique.
 
It would obviously not be subject to mobiles that already can't move,
such as guardians or malgad, etc. but it could make for some nifty
pk strategies.
 
It could be that if the spell was not at 100% it could throw the
enemy into a different direction, or even throw you into the direction
you'd specified. This spell should have a noticable cooldown.
 
There are other similar spells that could spring up from this one-
maybe a spell that lasts for sometime that prevents an enemy from
being in the same room, and if that character comes into the same
room as you, it's forced out into a random direction. If there were a
spell like this, one should get adrenaline at the end of the duration
of the spell so as to prevent douchebagery.
 
my two cents for the night.

Maybe some won't like this idea. But possibly having food

make you weaker then you are if you just leave it in your

might even lead to a spell/skill 'Preserve' for your food
items to insure they don't go bad and become your downfall.
Certain stages of rancidity are alright while others cause
a detriment to your performance due to illness. Unlike 
poison though it's not curable. [Sorry my Trade comes into

I was thinking preserve might even lead to other spells

on someone's bag or food supply. Which might cause for
some fun cuz if you don't know it's spoiled and start
eating could hurt ya. Unlike the poison flag that show
what is poison affected or with a weap flag temp or not
spoil could happen naturally as well so those who aren't
careful of their great numbers of food they stockpile
could poison themself. Just another tidbit for fun.

Quivers are fairly easy to make.  I did it once before
I see no reason why I couldn't do it again.
 
Did you know there are at least 8 kinds of intellegence
(and oh by the way, define intelligence).
 
How many men do you see having children?  Didn't think so.
 
What society ranks as strength and intelligence really
is a poor reflection for when you sit down and try and
accurately model it.
There are things men are better at than women, oh absolutely.
And are there things women are better at than men, again
absolutely.
However, can it be modeled with a simple int stat or a con/str
adjustment.  I think any such adjustment could not be applied
fairly given the system we have in place.
 
Anyways food for thought.

Text
I was thinking would it be possible for the winged races to
shoulder their wings and land so they aren't always flying?
An on off switch so to speak like 'furl' and 'unfurl'. Being
that sometimes you don't always wanna fly due to some of the 
detriments and sometimes you wanna for the benefits. Presently
it's only draco and Arial I think which have wings but speak
up people with constructive criticism about the ideas we need
more people giving them and more people commenting. Don't hide!
We need you!

This is the mandatory "Imote" note.
 
I think there's a command for it- "iemote," but if I recall correctly
it isn't logged for tokens. The imote command could make
things much more interesting- and it would probably encourage
more hands-on RP, and less note writing.
 
And tokens are always good :)
 
I also had an idea for a spell:
 
Extinguish: Gets rid of any temporary light that your opponent
may have, and renders any flaming weapon useless for a
couple of rounds. Would have a significant cooldown.

as of now, you can only type where to locate the first of any given set

I was thinkin perhaps allowing 4 man,5 man groups
on fate.For over a decade the code has been the same up
to 3 people group and anymore then that 0 exp.
4. 5. group would encourage more player interacting
and gtell fun making the leveling go faster and time.
It would also be a good change to see.For exp:
4 man group=1/3 exp cut from max gain.5=2/3 cut
etc
 
 
 
Just an idea.

Just an idea:
 
Maybe instead of making all wands and staff drop's level 1.
Maybe you could make them from level 1 to wtv current level the mobile is.
The chances of the level and spell on the wand/staff would be a random
roll of course.But that's just plain out cheese when a level 55 mobile drops
level 1 crap all the time.

The master archer in larinach has been altered.
Seem's whomever was messin with him,only changed
ne item on him,his deadly arrow's.Which are now avg 18
and the rest of his arrow's are an average of 55-60.  lol
 
 
Just is unfortunate,deadly arrow's were an avg of 70 something.
 
 
 
Think someone was havin some fun,cause now im stuck with a backpack
full of deadly arrow's that are avg 18.

I just finished firing off around 100 shot's/arrows to kill
a mobile,ack i mean around 1k maybe.Well I noticed when i hit
my target with arrows averaging 18 (deadly arrows) compared to broadhead 
arrows and venom tips,which are 50-55.They all did the same dmg,moreless.
 
I think arrow dmg is strictly and only based on strength.
 
 
 
 
Just thought id let cha know.

Yeah I know its pwipe or lvl cap, but right now a pwipe

I just finished firing off around 100 shot's/arrows to kill
a mobile,ack i mean around 1k maybe.Well I noticed when i hit
my target with arrows averaging 18 (deadly arrows) compared to broadhead 
arrows and venom tips,which are 50-55.They all did the same dmg,moreless.
 
I think arrow dmg is strictly and only based on strength.

From the start, people just bitched and moaned
I dont like this, I dont like that. Boo fucking who
And everyone wonders why fate went to the shitter
maybe its because (name not inserted) first of all
killed it by crying like a little whore until half the admin staff quit.
I really dont think that people relize what happens when one person
goes. When certain people leave, others either quit because of the bullshit
or do not contribute anymore ideas to the game becausde
once again... the bullshit.
 
 
I just gotta say, this was in no way a surprise to me.
But anyways, at this point, i'd rather play my halo 3, so if anyone
wants to play some halo online, hit me up with a note with

I knew fate would be shut down before the cap was removed.  So I

Or remove it in the first place?  Now we've been stuck with this cap
for like 2-3 months?  And for nothing?  Cap the level, and close the
game?  Nah man, doesnt work like that.  Atleast remove the cap, and
let us play without it.  I cant say for sure people will play with
the cap gone, but Im 100% sure I will play then.  Atleast people will
see one char on when they log on, better than none, right?

Yeah maybe removing the level cap will help... I know it
won't hurt. Sorry to see Qual go after all these years,
it was fun. Anyway, the pbase has given up I think. Fate
was down and up too many times, players protested and left
too many times... In the time the players were away they 
found other games, Halo 3, WoW, and whatever else. Kudos
to the imms for their effort to resurrect the mud. I still
sign on every now and then and level (solo, heh) but never
ever ever see anyone, so I guess I won't see you guys around
hehe. 
 
Being old school as I am, you can find me on:
Warcraft 3:   31337157
Halo 1 (comp): 31337157
Starcraft: (you guessed it) 31337157
AIM: VoidAfterUse

I would rather not have the lvl cap removed... because I dont

I'd rather just be able to make 20 characters that I will still have when
all the work is completed and the pbase builds up again.
 
Im still on every now and again and I plan on playing completly again
when the pbase goes back up.  But I like it being up and running so I can
get on and knock out some levels on random characters.  If we will be doing
a pwipe after all of this.. please let me know so I can stop making so many
random characters. :)

Maybe we should remove the level cap. I see another mortal
occasionally, but its been a long time since an immortal has
been here. Just thinking, everyone lost interest, maybe
we could ditch the level cap to get people back here.
 
Yeah I know its pwipe or lvl cap, but right now a pwipe
wouldn't matter because almost everyone quit using their
characters :P
 
Give it a shot, who knows.

I knew fate would be shut down before the cap was removed.  So I

Or remove it in the first place?  Now we've been stuck with this cap
for like 2-3 months?  And for nothing?  Cap the level, and close the
game?  Nah man, doesnt work like that.  Atleast remove the cap, and
let us play without it.  I cant say for sure people will play with

Yeah maybe removing the level cap will help... I know it

it was fun. Anyway, the pbase has given up I think. Fate
was down and up too many times, players protested and left
too many times... In the time the players were away they 
found other games, Halo 3, WoW, and whatever else. Kudos
to the imms for their effort to resurrect the mud. I still

I would rather not have the lvl cap removed... because I dont

I'd rather just be able to make 20 characters that I will still have when

Im still on every now and again and I plan on playing completly again
when the pbase goes back up.  But I like it being up and running so I can
get on and knock out some levels on random characters.  If we will be doing
a pwipe after all of this.. please let me know so I can stop making so many

Soon I'll be able to play more often.
 
 
As far as the level cap it should be removed b/c we currently have nobody
workin on the mud making changes from what i understand,so leave the mud 
as be for now and allow everyone to keep their chracters now and in the future.
Not like if it matter's really anyhow.

I just finished firing off around 100 shot's/arrows to kill
a mobile,ack i mean around 1k maybe.Well I noticed when i hit
my target with arrows averaging 18 (deadly arrows) compared to broadhead 
arrows and venom tips,which are 50-55.They all did the same dmg,moreless.
 
I think arrow dmg is strictly and only based on strength.

From the start, people just bitched and moaned
I dont like this, I dont like that. Boo fucking who
And everyone wonders why fate went to the shitter
maybe its because (name not inserted) first of all
killed it by crying like a little whore until half the admin staff quit.
I really dont think that people relize what happens when one person
goes. When certain people leave, others either quit because of the bullshit
or do not contribute anymore ideas to the game becausde
once again... the bullshit.
 
 
I just gotta say, this was in no way a surprise to me.
But anyways, at this point, i'd rather play my halo 3, so if anyone
wants to play some halo online, hit me up with a note with

I knew fate would be shut down before the cap was removed.  So I

Or remove it in the first place?  Now we've been stuck with this cap
for like 2-3 months?  And for nothing?  Cap the level, and close the
game?  Nah man, doesnt work like that.  Atleast remove the cap, and
let us play without it.  I cant say for sure people will play with
the cap gone, but Im 100% sure I will play then.  Atleast people will
see one char on when they log on, better than none, right?

Yeah maybe removing the level cap will help... I know it
won't hurt. Sorry to see Qual go after all these years,
it was fun. Anyway, the pbase has given up I think. Fate
was down and up too many times, players protested and left
too many times... In the time the players were away they 
found other games, Halo 3, WoW, and whatever else. Kudos
to the imms for their effort to resurrect the mud. I still
sign on every now and then and level (solo, heh) but never
ever ever see anyone, so I guess I won't see you guys around
hehe. 
 
Being old school as I am, you can find me on:
Warcraft 3:   31337157
Halo 1 (comp): 31337157
Starcraft: (you guessed it) 31337157

I would rather not have the lvl cap removed... because I dont
see any reason to play if the characters that I make will be deleted.
I'd rather just be able to make 20 characters that I will still have when
all the work is completed and the pbase builds up again.
 
Im still on every now and again and I plan on playing completly again
when the pbase goes back up.  But I like it being up and running so I can
get on and knock out some levels on random characters.  If we will be doing
a pwipe after all of this.. please let me know so I can stop making so many
random characters. :)

Yea I agree with Makus,I don't think the mud should shut down.
I am temporarily not playing due to being busy irl.
I enjoy spending time on here when I can,but just don't have much of that atm.
Soon I'll be able to play more often.
 
 
As far as the level cap it should be removed b/c we currently have nobody
workin on the mud making changes from what i understand,so leave the mud 
as be for now and allow everyone to keep their chracters now and in the future.
Not like if it matter's really anyhow.
