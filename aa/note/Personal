I forgot the name of my giant warrior that I havent played in a while.
If you could look it up for me that would be great.
I remember his password cuz I use the same one... so if you need
some proof that he is mine.. i can tell you it.

i am almost positive I didnt delete him.
hmm... hints.
I pk'd someone... im sure that list is pretty small.
his name started with a g...  something like gavalain or gavaelus or something
I have obviously fingered those and they arent it... but its something like that.
 
He is somewhere around 45.   If I saw his name... I would recognize it im
sure.  So... if you could just send me a note with all the characters that
start with g maybe i would remember.  Sry for having you waste time cuz Im
a moron :)
