I just finished firing off around 100 shot's/arrows to kill

my target with arrows averaging 18 (deadly arrows) compared to broadhead 
arrows and venom tips,which are 50-55.They all did the same dmg,moreless.
 
I think arrow dmg is strictly and only based on strength.

From the start, people just bitched and moaned
I dont like this, I dont like that. Boo fucking who
And everyone wonders why fate went to the shitter
maybe its because (name not inserted) first of all
killed it by crying like a little whore until half the admin staff quit.
I really dont think that people relize what happens when one person
goes. When certain people leave, others either quit because of the bullshit
or do not contribute anymore ideas to the game becausde
once again... the bullshit.
 
 
I just gotta say, this was in no way a surprise to me.

wants to play some halo online, hit me up with a note with

I knew fate would be shut down before the cap was removed.  So I

Or remove it in the first place?  Now we've been stuck with this cap
for like 2-3 months?  And for nothing?  Cap the level, and close the
game?  Nah man, doesnt work like that.  Atleast remove the cap, and
let us play without it.  I cant say for sure people will play with
the cap gone, but Im 100% sure I will play then.  Atleast people will
see one char on when they log on, better than none, right?

Yeah maybe removing the level cap will help... I know it
won't hurt. Sorry to see Qual go after all these years,
it was fun. Anyway, the pbase has given up I think. Fate
was down and up too many times, players protested and left
too many times... In the time the players were away they 
found other games, Halo 3, WoW, and whatever else. Kudos
to the imms for their effort to resurrect the mud. I still
sign on every now and then and level (solo, heh) but never
ever ever see anyone, so I guess I won't see you guys around
hehe. 
 
Being old school as I am, you can find me on:
Warcraft 3:   31337157
Halo 1 (comp): 31337157
Starcraft: (you guessed it) 31337157

I would rather not have the lvl cap removed... because I dont
see any reason to play if the characters that I make will be deleted.
I'd rather just be able to make 20 characters that I will still have when
all the work is completed and the pbase builds up again.
 
Im still on every now and again and I plan on playing completly again
when the pbase goes back up.  But I like it being up and running so I can
get on and knock out some levels on random characters.  If we will be doing
a pwipe after all of this.. please let me know so I can stop making so many
random characters. :)

Yea I agree with Makus,I don't think the mud should shut down.
I am temporarily not playing due to being busy irl.
I enjoy spending time on here when I can,but just don't have much of that atm.
Soon I'll be able to play more often.
 
 
As far as the level cap it should be removed b/c we currently have nobody
workin on the mud making changes from what i understand,so leave the mud 
as be for now and allow everyone to keep their chracters now and in the future.
Not like if it matter's really anyhow.
