LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?

I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.
 
Think about it and let me know what you'd charge and get back to me.
 
Thanks.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?

I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.
 
Think about it and let me know what you'd charge and get back to me.
 
Thanks.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with

I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game

with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.
 
Think about it and let me know what you'd charge and get back to me.
 
Thanks.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?

I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.
 
Think about it and let me know what you'd charge and get back to me.
 
Thanks.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with

I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game

with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.
 
Think about it and let me know what you'd charge and get back to me.
 
Thanks.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?

I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.
 
Think about it and let me know what you'd charge and get back to me.
 
Thanks.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

This is an outside question but pertaining to eq and buying it.
I am interested in getting 3 aluminum baseball bats and would like
to know if you'd be interested in obtaining them for me for a price.

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

LOL, you made the church eq totally worthless. Why did you do that?
You dont play now so now you realise its overpowered? :P
I think you just made spellcasters a lil more suckier again.
We'll wait and see though. I was getting 40 mana a level, about 
10-15 HP. Gonna be fun to see how much I get next level. :)

Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the 
stance I think some of the OOL and PK helps need to be
updated with clear, concise "rules" so there is no and's
if's or but's about it. My hope is to prevent more ooc 
based PK and yes even I talked to vish and the rest about
us just ignoring them due to even I was annoyed with 
Lukinos last night I will do my part so if there is things
I can do to help out with rules or additions to the game
let me know or if there is an issue you can't resolve
with a player I know let me know I will help out. Look
forward to working with some of you I don't know and those
I do know I say "hey again did ya miss me?" :)

Subject Bounty of Lukinos~
Text
Due to an unsightly death at the hand of one Lukinos on my
preparation to leave for dinner for what would be no apparent
true RP reason. Short of a short few sentences changed over
from OOC at Kazmir's request. THe conversation remained OOC
but it was his only reason for the kill. As such an unjust 
kill was made for obvious reasons that were OOC I think the
justification for what would be a seemingly meaningless 
kill that was not even contested while waiting to log off this
reaction to such an act is justified. If only to apply pressure
to disuade such actions on his part once more.

I think just so everyone is sure of the range in which OOL
will affect them needs to be stated in OOL or PK at the 
very least since neither at this moment state the actual
range. I could be mistaken but I'm almost sure the range
used to be about 10 a while back. Or at least that's what
was allowed to get away with. I think it needs to be stated
very clear and precise this is the range. Not to mention
there is another issue which was brought up in a note by
Lukinos which brings up a good point.
 
How are you going to deal with being grouped with someone
who may or may not be in your attackers range. If you are
the victim of a malicious revenge plot and your groupie
doesn't have time to flee before said person is dead. Is
it really right they be punished? I think some of the
rules laid down need a little redefining or altering as
some pose some real issues. As for my stance on issues of
last night it was handled well and even if I am friends
with jamven and vishtaar I support what was done. As does
Jamven understanding why it happened. It sent the message
of no nonsense on these issues. But There is still the

Im so sick of this guy, this is the about 5th time ive bitched about 
him either through msn, ooc, tell and notes now. Im sick of trying
to play, writing my background, rping, every fucking bit of this game
i do and i have to listen to his faggot mouth. He has to nit pick at 
SOMETHING all the time and then when i defend myself i always get
 "stop whining" or and i quote [OOC] Macha: 'as you said before mikael
fuck off and go be emo in a corner'
 
 
Seriously, im trying to mature approach first and reporting it, but
it doesnt seem to be working. If it comes down too it then itll just
be me giving him a reason to bitch at him.
 
And now that is not a threat, im just pissed and sick and tired of his
shit.

You see standing before you a young looking drow with a muscular, 
athletic build and slightly above average height. He would look like 
any other drow except for his grey tinted skin and piercing black eyes.
He has long silvery, white hair that is tied back from his face which
only draws more attention to his interesting eyes.

You see standing before you a young looking drow with a muscular, 
athletic build and slightly above average height. He would look like 
any other drow except for his grey tinted skin and piercing black eyes.
He has long silvery, white hair that is tied back from his face which
only draws more attention to his interesting eyes.

The old man has it yea, not sure what the drop chances are.

Might be like heirloom, but I doubt it has that low spawn chance.

The old man has it yea, not sure what the drop chances are.
And it's hidden, but you knew that :)
Might be like heirloom, but I doubt it has that low spawn chance.
Anyways, lemme know if you need someone with det hidden, I'll help
ya out if you help me get a pair :)

Yea your right,it has a low chance of repopping.i had to kill
the old man around 4-5 times to get another one to drop.
I also found some staves in blackwater  canyon that cast
animal essence so i have detects now.

I checked in today and noticed that you were at the healer
with 2 corpses and were starving.  I forced you to pick up
all of your gear and gold and disconnected you and unloaded
you.  If you are going to set up triggers to keep your player
online make sure you set up triggers to keep him eating and
drinking too.

As much as I would like to have Macha back; what was happening
I do not believe to be healthy for anyone.  Especially given
that according to Macha he set his msn to block Zalev.
 
Given this, I am not sure Macha would agree to what you 
have written; and if he did, I am not sure it would be
any good to anyone.  At some point, if someone is truly
unhappy, and there appears no way to rectify the problem (which
was the case); then there is only one solution, which Macha choose
on his own desire.
 
Anyways I am sorry your plans were affected by this entire
travisty.

If you could look it up for me that would be great.
I remember his password cuz I use the same one... so if you need
some proof that he is mine.. i can tell you it.

i am almost positive I didnt delete him.
hmm... hints.
I pk'd someone... im sure that list is pretty small.
his name started with a g...  something like gavalain or gavaelus or something
I have obviously fingered those and they arent it... but its something like that.
 
He is somewhere around 45.   If I saw his name... I would recognize it im
sure.  So... if you could just send me a note with all the characters that
start with g maybe i would remember.  Sry for having you waste time cuz Im
a moron :)
