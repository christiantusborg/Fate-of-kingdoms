Desc {cA tall male humanoid is here.  He stands roughly six feet tall,
and looks to weigh around 165 pounds.  Kormien sa'Gorn has long,
{Dblack{c hair that falls to his shoulders in soft waves.  His eyes
are a cold {wgr{Wey{c color, though they seem to burn with a cold
fire.  His clean-shaven face has a strange quality to it, a certain
thing that makes his age hard to guess.  His skin has a slightly
golden tinge.  He is a demonic storm in a teacup.  {x

Immtitle Immortal~
Back The demon Zelphax roared.  Kormien sa'Gorn, Angel's Bane, Keeper
of Darkness, hovered in the dim grey expanse of the Void.  The
shadowy form of Zelphax loomed over him, eyes of fire blazing with
spite.  "We are inexorably linked, you and I," the greater demon
spat.  "You can never escape me.  What I give you now, this gift, it
does not come freely."  Kormien stared into the blazing eyes.  "I'm
not an idiot, Zelphax.  I know you never "give" anything to anyone." 
Floating closer to what seemed to be a multifaceted glass window;
Kormien could see the blue marble of Thera floating within the
endless expanse of time and space.  It was his ticket out of the
afterlife.  "I wonder, though.  You have railed about power since I
came into your service uncounted years ago.  But where was your power
when Narssius broke?  Where was your power when indominatible
Torsanctus was overthrown?  Your servants called out to you, and you
abandoned us.  How will this time be different?"  Zelphax's form
appeared obstinate.  "You try me, mortal.  Know only that I am giving
you this chance at life, and you may take or leave this offer.  I'll
have none of your acid tongue.  Will you take my power, and go back
into Thera?"  Kormien looked to the world, and back at Zelphax.  "I
accept your proposal, demon.  As it was long ago, so shall it be
again.  I can only pray that you'll hold your end of the bargain,
this time."  With that, the demon Zelphax grinned.  Kormien felt his
fabric of being expand as the demonic forces entered his soul.  The
world went black.  A blinding flash of light filled Kormien's steel
grey eyes.  It took him several minutes to realize that he was seeing
the sun - the true Theran sun - for the first time in ages.  Muddy
grass crumpled in his fists as he pushed himself to his feet.  Solid
ground supported him.  This truly was Thera.  This was home.  How
were things different?  This remains to be seen.  One thing for
certain, the merging with Zelphax's demonic forces left Kormien
marked.  He would soon see that his skin had a golden tinge to it,
and his ears were very slightly pointed.  These physical changes were
marginal, however, compared to the changes in his soul.  The former
Black Knight felt that most of his combat skills would be useless to
him.  Now, perhaps as a product of his merging, he felt the eldritch
forces of necromancy flowing over his soul, a perpetual slick, oily
feeling.  Kormien sa'Gorn, once a simple human being from a backwater
Sanarian province, had become something different.  Kormien sa'Gorn
had become something Else.
