Desc Before you stands a bird-like creature a jumbled mass of parts
from both man and avian.  At what looks to be it shoulders a pair of
wings extend outward reaching upwards the blackish blue hue
glistening with a shine.  Narrowed milky white eyes void of a
noticable pupil stare blankly.  Its beaked mouth quirked in an almost
imperceptable smirk.  A long slender neck leading down to a slender
torso resembling that of a man.  Long lithe arms hanging with a pair
of appendages akin to a talon of a bird but also of a man's hand. 
Long spindly legs graced with another foot like appendage also
resembling that of a talon rests gracefully aside from the constant
twitching it makes.  Feathers poking out at seemingly random
locations on the body with the bluish black feathers.  The somewhat
menacing appearances is somehow demeaning or lacking due to its short
stature.  Standing no more then a full nine hands tall and its light
frame appearing to be no more then a good twenty five to thirty
stones in weight.

Immtitle Immortal~
Back The noble winged race dwelling upon the highest peaks the proud
birdmen existed away from most mortal races and their goings on. 
Many left the sanctuary of the mountain peaks for their own purposes
as champions of good or to appease their own curiousity.  This is no
such tale, the story of Kithane is no ordinary story of heroics or
deeds of bravery.  When he left the peaks of the mountain is still
yet undetermined as each story only agree's on one thing, that no
story can agree on the exact reason or when.  Amongst the "lesser"
races who were without their wings the young bird did dwell along
this road he picked up a strange trade.  The wardens of the wood,
Protectors of the beautiful lands, Keepers of the natural law, so
many names for it's trade the path of the ranger he did walk with
great zeal.  Often times too much taking the traditions past normalcy
into the extremist of sense.  Some stories speak that the young
birdman is directly responsible for the disappearance of certain
small villages with his as some put it crazy and outrageous philosphy
of saving the forest from the "killers.  No accounts of such stories
have been confirmated and grounded in fact and remain as just rumors
lingering the lands.

Moving about the lands from forest to forest prefroming so called
"good deeds" along the path he currently walks.  Hoping to teach the
ignorant fools of their crimes against the great forest mother's
bounty.  Others claim him to be a foolish religious zealot, others
and escaped looney from the midst of arkham.  He remains upon his
path walking the lone road strange as that path may be.
