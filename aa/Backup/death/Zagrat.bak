Ques 4
Desc Before you stand a humanoid creature by the name of zagrat.  He is
an average-sized orc with very dark gray skin.  He has quite a number
of scars on his face suggesting that he has been fighting quite a
bit.  He also carries an amulet with a skull attached to it.  He has
no hair on his head exept for some gray facial hair that looks kind
of messy.  He has some markings on his left shoulder that looks like
two humanoids fighting.

Back Well then, so you wish to know more about zagrat now?  Tho I do
not know everything about him I can tell you what I know.  He came
from a small tribe of orcs from lands unknown, even to himself.  He
did'nt really fit in there as he were communing with the divine for
help one day and the elders of the tribe did not like people that
asked the divine and considered him weak.  He then challenged his
elder to a fight to prove his strengt.  They fought for several hours
and then he lost and from that day he were exiled from his village. 
And so he vandered off to see what was outside the village, but soon
passed out from the wounds after the fight.  Some time later he woke
up at the inn of city called Sanaria.  It would appear some travelers
had found him passed out and brought him there.  At this point he
could not remember where he was from, all he could remember was his
name.  He soon found out he wanted to be a cleric so he could become
strong enough to survive these lands on his own and also to one day
get his memories back.  Some time later he met a drow called Silven
who was in fact a druid which he thought was quite weird as he had
never seen a druid before.  He than joined join Silven and they
became traveling companions and good friends as well.  They later met
a traveler who was up to no good and even tried to kill them, but
after the fight the traveler ended up dead.  Zagrat then took some of
his blood and drank it and at that point his wounds started to heal. 
They did not know who or what this traveler was, but thing they could
agree on: he was probably hired by someone else.  However they did
not know who hired him and why and so they did not worry about it.
